### **Phenomenology**

Phenomenology begins with the premise that truth is encountered through lived experience rather than through abstract ideas about reality. It prioritizes perception, embodiment, and consciousness as the primary access points to what is real, treating experience itself as the ground of knowledge.

From a phenomenological view, reality is not neutral or uniform across observers. Two people may encounter the same event, yet the truth of that event differs because it is shaped by how it is lived. Meaning is not assumed in advance; it arises through direct encounter.

Phenomenology therefore shifts philosophy away from explanation and toward description. Instead of asking what an experience _should_ mean, it examines how it is actually experienced from within.

### **Relation to Integration**

The [[Philosophy of Integration]] aligns with phenomenology in treating experience as primary, but extends the inquiry to include how experience is structured internally. Integration is concerned not only with what is lived, but with how awareness relates to that experience: whether it remains open, becomes distorted, or reorganizes around protection.

Experience provides access.  
Awareness determines coherence.

From this perspective, phenomenology supplies the ground layer of contact, while Integration describes the architecture through which that contact is held, interpreted, and acted upon.

> Experience reveals reality. Awareness reveals the relationship to it.
