Resolution is not a moment of agreement, reconciliation, or moral settlement. It is the point at which a relational system stops bleeding.

Relationally, resolution appears as a shift from tension to stability rather than from conflict to harmony. It does not require that people forgive, repair, or even understand one another fully. It requires only that harm no longer circulates through the network of relationships.

In lived experience, resolution often feels understated rather than dramatic. It may look like:

- a settling of nervous energy in a room
    
- fewer reactive thoughts about what happened
    
- conversations that no longer loop
    
- boundaries that no longer feel effortful
    
- the absence of urgency rather than the presence of closure
    

Resolution arrives when the causal chain has run its course and containment has done its work. The original event may still be remembered, but it no longer organizes present behaviour.

Relationally, resolution does not erase loss or repair what cannot be repaired. Instead, it allows people to inhabit reality without being governed by the rupture. Life resumes its forward movement in a new configuration.

When resolution is absent, relationships remain stuck in a semi-active state: stories rehearse, positions harden, and the past continually intrudes on the present. The system remains unfinished.

When resolution is present, relationships reorganize around what is now true. Trust may or may not return, proximity may change, and roles may shift — but the shared world becomes workable again.

Resolution therefore completes the sequence that began with consequence and was shaped by containment. Consequence reveals what happened; containment limits further harm; **resolution restores relational continuity.**

In this sense, resolution is not a moral achievement — it is a structural stabilization.
