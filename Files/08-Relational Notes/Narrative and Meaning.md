### **Overview**

Narrative and meaning are human mechanisms for organizing experience. They are not equivalent.

Narrative describes sequence.  
Meaning stabilizes identity.

When meaning replaces resolution, causal chains remain open.

### **The Arc of Narrative**

Narrative is how experience is interpreted, remembered, and communicated.

It can:

- clarify sequence
    
- preserve context
    
- support learning
    

Narrative becomes distortive when it substitutes explanation for contact with experience. At that point, story replaces consequence.

Narrative is functional until it hardens.

### **The Turn Toward Meaning**

Meaning is extracted from narrative to provide psychological stability.

It answers:

- who I am
    
- what this says about me
    
- why this happened _to me_
    

Meaning often arrests movement. It freezes experience into identity, belief, or moral conclusion.

When meaning is prioritized over resolution, distortion persists.

### **Integration Point**

Narrative can support coherence.  
Meaning often interrupts it.

Integration does not eliminate narrative. It releases attachment to meaning when meaning blocks closure.
