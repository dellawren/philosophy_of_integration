Containment is not something done _to_ a person; it is something that happens _between_ people, conditions, and relationships when risk becomes visible.

Relationally, containment shows up as shifts in proximity, access, and expectation rather than as coercion or control. People move, boundaries form, doors close, and pathways of harm narrow. This is not punishment; it is the system re-organizing around what has been revealed.

In lived experience, containment often feels quiet rather than dramatic. It may look like:

- choosing distance instead of confrontation
    
- changing how much information is shared
    
- limiting contact without making a public case
    
- altering environments so certain dynamics cannot repeat
    
- redirecting interaction rather than escalating it
    

The relational function of containment is simple: to reduce the likelihood that harm will travel further through the network of relationships.

When containment is absent, relationships remain porous to damage. Harm circulates, stories harden, sides form, and new ruptures are created. The original event multiplies rather than settles.

When containment is clear, relationships can stabilize. People are not forced into harmony; they are given conditions where coherence becomes possible again. Trust may or may not return — but the system stops bleeding.

Containment therefore sits between consequence and resolution. Consequence reveals what happened; containment shapes the field in which people must live with what happened.

In this sense, containment is a relational act of care — not care for the person who caused harm, and not care as sentimentality — but care for the continuity of the shared world.
