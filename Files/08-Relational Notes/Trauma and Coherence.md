## Overview

Trauma and coherence are not opposites.  
They are configurations of the same causal architecture under different regulatory conditions.

Trauma occurs when environmental conditions require survival regulation to replace participatory regulation.  
Coherence becomes possible when participatory regulation can resume without survival override.

Trauma reorganizes the chain around protection.  
Coherence reorganizes the chain around continuity.

Trauma is not outside the architecture.  
It is the architecture operating under survival priority.

## Trauma: Survival Architecture

Trauma forms when environmental load requires the system to prioritize safety over participation.

Under these conditions, the chain reorganizes around protection:

- perception narrows toward threat  
- emotion becomes defensive  
- memory retains survival charge  
- interpretation contracts  
- identity attaches to safety  
- biological systems brace  
- behavior compensates  
- relational patterns distort  

Trauma is not the event.  
It is the structure that formed when participation was no longer safe.

This architecture persists not because danger remains, but because the system has not yet returned to participatory regulation.

---

## Coherence: Participatory Continuity Restored

Coherence becomes available when the system can remain participatory without needing survival priority.

In this configuration:

- awareness registers sequence directly  
- interpretation loses defensive priority  
- emotion remains signal rather than directive  
- memory can be held without survival activation  
- time regains continuity  
- behavior aligns proportionally  

Coherence does not oppose trauma.  
It renders survival architecture unnecessary.

Where trauma required protection, coherence restores participation.

---

## Structural Relationship

Trauma and coherence do not coexist at the same operational layer.

- Trauma indicates survival regulation dominating the system.  
- Coherence indicates participatory regulation is possible again.

As coherence becomes available, the architectural functions trauma performed lose necessity.

Protection releases.  
Orientation shifts.  
The chain resumes participation.

---

## Integration Point

Integration occurs when survival architecture no longer governs orientation and becomes informational rather than protective.

At this point:

- perception widens  
- identity releases survival posture  
- memory loses survival charge  
- emotion completes naturally  
- interpretation recalibrates  
- behavior reorganizes without enforcement  

Coherence does not heal trauma.  
It replaces the need for the architecture trauma required.

> Trauma prioritizes safety over participation.  
> Coherence restores the ability to participate.
