**Systemic Interference** — the structural alteration of a causal chain when consequence is displaced from its originating path by an intermediary structure.

Systemic interference does not require intent, authority, or decision-making.  
It is defined solely by **positional occupation within a chain**.

---

## **Structural Definition**

In an uninterrupted chain:

**Cause → Effect → Consequence → Resolution**

Under systemic interference:

**Cause → Intermediary Occupation → Substituted Consequence**

The original chain does not complete.  
Consequence does not return to its point of origin.  
Resolution does not occur.

The chain remains **open**.

---

## **Interference Condition**

Systemic interference occurs when:

- consequence is prevented from mapping back to its initiating cause
    
- an intermediary structure occupies the consequence position
    
- causal return is redirected, deferred, or abstracted
    
- closure is structurally unavailable
    

No motive is implied.  
No justification is assumed.

Interference is a **configuration**, not an action.

---

## **Structural Effects**

When systemic interference is present:

- causal continuity is broken
    
- consequence loses positional specificity
    
- resolution is structurally deferred
    
- secondary chains form to manage unresolved load
    
- repetition becomes inevitable
    

These effects follow regardless of intention or design.

---

## **Open Chain Generation**

Systemic interference produces **open chain states**.

An open chain:

- continues to seek completion
    
- repeats interaction without resolution
    
- displaces expression across contexts
    
- accumulates secondary compensatory structures
    

This persistence is not resistance, pathology, or failure.  
It is **causal continuity under obstruction**.

---

## **Relation to Mediation**

Systemic interference describes **what happens** when an intermediary occupies a causal position.

The **Causal Mediation Principle** formalizes the consequence of this occupation:

- mediation replaces consequence
    
- substituted consequence cannot close the original chain
    
- the system must persist to manage the unresolved state
    

Interference is the configuration.  
Mediation is the law governing its effects.

---

## **Relational Implications (Structural)**

When systemic interference occurs between chain actors:

- relational consequence is displaced
    
- causal return cannot occur within the relationship
    
- interaction stabilizes into patterned repetition
    

This produces **relational loops** not through emotion or failure,  
but through interrupted causal completion.

---

## **Structural Summary**

- Interference occurs through positional substitution, not intent
    
- Consequence is displaced rather than eliminated
    
- Chains remain open by structure
    
- Repetition and escalation follow mechanically
    
- Additional structure is required to manage unresolved load
    

> **When consequence is structurally replaced, repetition becomes inevitable.**

---

## **Scope Note**

This note defines **what interference looks like architecturally**.

- Human interpretation of systems belongs outside core architecture
    
- Moral, social, or experiential explanations are intentionally excluded
    
- Behavioral outcomes are addressed downstream
    

This preserves architectural neutrality.
