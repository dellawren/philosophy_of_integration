**Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops** defines the **structural requirements** under which a relational loop can achieve closure.

Relational loops resolve only when **closure conditions** are met.  
Change without closure produces **substitution**, not resolution.

---

### **Structural Conditions of Resolution**

Resolution occurs when:

- shared unresolved load is redistributed or completed
    
- causal return becomes structurally possible
    
- coupling between chains dissolves or reconfigures
    

These conditions operate at the **relational level**, not within any single chain.

---

### **Forms of Resolution**

When closure conditions are met, outcomes may include:

- dissolution of the relational loop
    
- reconfiguration into a new relational structure
    
- separation following closure
    

These outcomes differ in form, but share a common requirement:  
**causal completion precedes structural change**.

---

### **Resolution vs Substitution**

Structural change without closure produces substitution.

- patterns may shift
    
- roles may rotate
    
- surfaces may change
    

But unresolved load remains active.

Substitution preserves persistence under a new configuration.  
Resolution eliminates the need for persistence.

See [[Relational Loop Decay]] and [[Why Insight Doesn't Break Loops]].

### **Relation to Coupling and Load**

Because relational loops are defined by **shared load**:

- closure cannot occur unilaterally
    
- resolution requires redistribution or completion
    
- coupling must dissolve or reconfigure
    

See [[Coupled Chains and Shared Load]] and [[Relational Loops vs Individual Chains]].

---

### **Relation to Mediation**

Under mediated conditions, closure is structurally unavailable.

- consequence cannot return to origin
    
- shared load persists
    
- resolution is deferred
    

These constraints are formalized in the [[Causal Mediation Principle]].

---

### **Scope Note**

This note defines **what must occur structurally for resolution**.

It does not explain:

- how resolution is initiated
    
- human strategies or interventions
    
- experiential closure or relief
    

Those interpretations belong outside the mechanics layer.
