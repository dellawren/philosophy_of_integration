  og:title: "Coupled Chains and Shared Load"
  description: Describes how causal chains become coupled across actors, creating shared load that binds participants into persistent relational patterns.

**Coupled Chains** — two or more causal chains that have become **structurally interdependent** such that closure can no longer occur independently within any single chain.

Coupling is a structural condition, not an interactional one.

### **Structural Properties of Coupling**

When chains couple:

- causal return cannot resolve to a single origin
    
- unresolved load is distributed across participating chains
    
- no individual chain can complete unilaterally
    

Shared load produces **persistence**.

The relational structure itself becomes **load-bearing**, maintaining continuity even when individual chain activity fluctuates.

---

### **Load Distribution**

Unresolved causal load does not dissipate.

Under coupling:

- load is redistributed rather than completed
    
- closure conditions shift from individual to relational
    
- persistence emerges mechanically
    

This redistribution marks the transition from individual chains to a **relational loop**.

See [[What Is a Relational Loop]].

### **Relation to Stability**

Once coupling occurs, differences in load distribution shape persistence.

- equal distribution produces lower stability
    
- unequal distribution increases containment
    
- asymmetry increases resistance to change
    

These properties are described in [[Asymmetry and Stability]].

### **Relation to Decoupling**

Coupling defines the conditions under which destabilization occurs.

When coupling weakens:

- shared load redistributes
    
- structural equilibrium shifts
    
- destabilization follows mechanically
    

See [[Load Redistribution Under Decoupling]].

### **Scope Note**

This note explains **how chains become structurally interdependent**.

It does not explain:

- why coupling occurs → see [[Relational Loop Theory]]
    
- how mediated interference produces coupling → see [[Systemic Interference]]
    
- how closure occurs → see [[Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops]]
    
- human experience of relational attachment
