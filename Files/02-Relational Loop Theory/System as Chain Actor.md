**System as Chain Actor** — a non-sentient structural configuration that can occupy a causal position within a chain by mediating, redirecting, or suspending consequence.

A system is not an agent.  
It does not intend, decide, judge, or learn.

It functions as a **causal intermediary**.

---

### **Definition Constraint**

A system becomes a chain actor **only** when it occupies a causal position that would otherwise be held by natural consequence.

This occurs when a structure:

- intercepts an active cause–effect sequence
    
- substitutes abstract consequence for direct consequence
    
- preserves procedural continuity in place of chain completion
    

No motive is required.  
No authority is implied.

---

### **Structural Properties**

When a system occupies a chain position:

- the original causal path is interrupted
    
- consequence is displaced away from the initiating event
    
- closure is deferred rather than completed
    
- unresolved load persists within the broader structure
    
- repetition becomes structurally necessary
    

The system does not “absorb” consequence in a human sense.  
It **holds a causal position open**.

---

### **Non-Agency Clarification**

A system does not cause effects the way individuals do.

- it does not initiate from awareness
    
- it does not register consequence
    
- it does not integrate outcome
    

It functions as a **relay node**, not a source.

> A system does not resolve or distort.  
> It **repositions causality**.

---

### **Why This Concept Is Architecturally Required**

Without this node, the framework cannot explain:

- how chains remain open without an individual actor
    
- how consequence can be displaced without disappearing
    
- why escalation occurs without intent
    
- why closure fails even when no one is “at fault”
    

This concept explains **structural occupation**, not behavior, morality, or failure.

---

### **Scope Note**

This note defines **how causality can be structurally occupied by non-sentient configurations**.

- System behavior is not evaluated here
    
- Human interpretation of systems belongs in the human layer
    
- Mediation effects are formalized in the _Causal Mediation Principle_
    

This prevents moralization, blame, and defense from entering the architecture.
