**The Dark Night of the Soul isn’t depression. Don’t turn it into that.**  
It’s not a mental health crisis—it’s a full system reboot.  
It’s the part of healing where everything false burns off.  
Not because you’re broken, but because you’re waking up.

It’s the disorientation that happens when the stories stop working.  
When you no longer believe the roles you were given:  
Who you’re supposed to be.  
What you’re allowed to feel.  
How you’re expected to live.

This isn’t about hopelessness—it’s about emptiness.  
The space left behind when identity crumbles and nothing replaces it.  
Yet.

It’s not meant to be fixed. It’s meant to **reorganize** you.

And that reorganization happens in the quiet.  
No grand revelations. No divine fireworks.  
Just you, sitting in the heat of your own truth,  
longer than you thought you could.  
Waiting for the moment when the truth arrives.

You are who you were meant to be.  
The world didn’t change you.  
You changed yourself.  
You’re free to go back.  
You’re free to start again.  
You’re free to become who you truly are.
