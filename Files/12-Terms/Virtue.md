**Virtue** refers to the stabilization of goodness into identity.

Within the framework, virtue describes a pattern where socially approved behaviours are internalized and repeated as evidence of moral worth. Virtue prioritizes consistency of character over responsiveness to consequence.

Virtue replaces situational awareness with fixed self-concept.  
It maintains moral coherence even when structural coherence is lost.

Virtue rewards reliability of appearance, not accuracy of perception.
