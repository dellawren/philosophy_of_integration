> **Sequence** — the ordered flow in which events, actions, sensations, and consequences are experienced over time.

Sequence does not imply causation, meaning, intention, or interpretation. It describes only the ordering through which experience becomes intelligible to humans.

Sequence is what allows continuity to be inferred, memory to function, and perception to be usable for action.

## Structural Clarifications

- Sequence is perceived, not constructed
    
- Sequence is required for experience to be intelligible
    
- Sequence precedes meaning, interpretation, and narrative
    
- When sequence is obscured by overlay, fragmentation occurs
