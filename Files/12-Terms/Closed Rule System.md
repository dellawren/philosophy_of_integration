**Closed Rule System** — a system in which cause and effect are mechanically enforced, producing defined outcomes once explicit conditions are met.

A closed rule system operates independently of human meaning, belief, or intention. Its rules are fixed, its thresholds are known, and its responses are automatic or procedural. Once a condition is crossed, the outcome follows without interpretation.

These systems do not negotiate. Delay, avoidance, or justification may occur at the human level, but they do not alter resolution unless the system itself is structurally changed. Closed rule systems remain legible precisely because they are indifferent to narrative.

Within the Integration framework, closed rule systems reveal the difference between **recognition** and **control**. They require acknowledgment, not moral agreement.
