**Situated Determinism** — the condition in which freedom and inevitability coexist within a single causal architecture.

Situated determinism holds that every moment arises from conditions already in motion — biological, relational, historical, emotional, and environmental. These conditions determine the situation that is present, but not the response that follows.

Within the Integration framework, determinism governs **cause and effect**: what has already occurred and what conditions are active. Freedom appears **after** effect, at the point where awareness registers the situation and choice becomes possible. Freedom does not precede causality and does not negate it. It operates within it.

Situated determinism rejects both absolute determinism, which denies freedom, and absolute free will, which assumes action must be uncaused. Instead, it locates freedom in orientation rather than origin — not in controlling the cause, but in relating to the effect.

Awareness does not prescribe action.  
Choice is not obligated toward resolution, correction, engagement, or withdrawal.  
Non-action is as structurally valid as action.

Situated determinism preserves inevitability without fatalism and freedom without exemption.
