> **Coherence** — the condition in which awareness perceives events in sequence without additional narrative, evaluative, or meaning-making overlay.

In this framework, _sequence_ refers only to the ordered flow in which events, actions, sensations, and consequences are experienced prior to explanation or interpretation.

Coherence is not agreement, calm, neutrality, or correctness. It is the absence of added overlay.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, coherence is defined negatively: it is what remains when interpretation does not replace perception.

When overlay is present, coherence is obscured.  
When overlay is recognized as overlay, coherence is evident.

Coherence allows contradiction, emotion, tension, and complexity without collapse because nothing is required to resolve, justify, or conform. Experience is simply not replaced by story.

Coherence does not indicate accurate perception of reality. It indicates reduced interference from overlay.

## Structural Summary

Coherence is not perceptual fidelity.  
Coherence is the absence of added narrative beyond what is required to perceive sequence.

> Coherence is functional, not epistemic.
