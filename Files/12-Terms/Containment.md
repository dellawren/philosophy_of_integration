Containment is the action that prevents harm from propagating through a relational system.

It does not punish people; it limits pathways of risk. Its aim is not moral settlement but stabilization — allowing consequences to unfold without escalation.

Containment is directed toward conditions, access, and relationships, not toward the person as an object to be controlled.

When containment is absent, ruptures multiply into new loops of harm.  
When containment is clear, the system can reorganize toward coherence.

Containment is how a system protects its continuity while consequences do their work.
