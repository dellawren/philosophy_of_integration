Foundational causal sequences formed in response to overwhelming conditions.

Primary Chains arise when a system is exposed to load that exceeds its capacity to process, escape, or interrupt. They are not chosen, symbolic, or interpretive. They are **direct effects of cause and effect operating under constraint**.

Within the Integration framework, Primary Chains describe the first-order architecture that forms when survival is at stake. In trauma contexts, this often appears as persistent threat prediction or hypervigilant regulation. These chains carry high energetic cost and tend to reproduce themselves until the conditions that generated them are no longer present.

Primary Chains are frequently misunderstood as identity, pathology, or personal failure. In reality, they are **structural adaptations**. They exist because, at the time of formation, no alternative sequence was viable.

> “Where capacity is exceeded, coherence reorganizes around survival.”
