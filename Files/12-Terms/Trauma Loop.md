**Trauma Loop** — a repeating internal circuit created when the chain bends around an overwhelming experience. The loop recycles emotion, memory, interpretation, and biology until awareness can break the pattern.

A trauma loop is not caused by the event — it is caused by the architecture built to survive it. The loop continues because the chain was never completed, and the system still believes the distortion is necessary. Trauma loops appear as repeated relationships, emotional reactions, fears, patterns, or life themes.

A trauma loop ends not through force, but through awareness, neutrality, and replacement.

> A trauma loop is not a failure — it’s the architecture waiting for completion.
