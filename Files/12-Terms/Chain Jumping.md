**Chain Jumping** — the transition from one causal architecture to another through non-participation in a distorted chain.

Chain jumping occurs when awareness disengages from a looping or distorted causal sequence and enters a coherent sequence without mediation, repair, or gradual resolution. The subjective experience may feel abrupt or discontinuous, but the shift is structural rather than metaphysical.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, chain jumping is not a change of reality but a change of **which causal chain is active**. The prior chain does not transform or resolve; it loses momentum through lack of reinforcement. The new chain stabilizes because it is coherent.

Chain jumping is therefore the experiential result of moving from **circular time** to **linear time** within the chain’s architecture. What feels like a sudden “new reality” is the absence of repetition, not the creation of an alternate timeline.

> Chain jumping is the end of participation in a loop, not a leap between worlds.
