> **Overlay** — the addition of narrative, evaluation, meaning, or identity beyond what is required to perceive events in sequence.

Overlay is not part of events themselves. It is not contained within the system. It is a mode in which awareness operates when interpretation replaces direct perception of sequence.

Overlay does not alter what occurs. It alters how what occurs is experienced.

## Structural Clarifications

- Overlay follows perception; it does not precede it
    
- Overlay is not a component that can be isolated or removed
    
- Overlay is a mode of operation in which interpretation substitutes for sequence
    
- When overlay is recognized as overlay, the mode shifts and sequence becomes visible again
    
- This shift produces systemic reconfiguration, not incremental change
    

Overlay is not something the system has.  
Overlay is how the system is operating at that moment.

## Relationship to Core Concepts

- **Coherence** — absence of overlay
    
- **Fragmentation** — operation within overlay
    
- **Meaning** — product of overlay
    
- **Meaning-making** — activity of overlay
    
- **Truth** — perception prior to overlay

## Structural Summary

Overlay is the moment interpretation becomes primary and sequence becomes secondary.

> Overlay is a mode of perception, not a feature of reality.
