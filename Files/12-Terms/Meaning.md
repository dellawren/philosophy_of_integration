**Meaning** — the interpretation humans assign to events after continuity has been perceived through sequence.

Meaning does not exist within cause and effect.  
It arises from the mind’s attempt to explain, justify, evaluate, or narrate what has already occurred.

Meaning is not discovered in events.  
Meaning is added to events.

## Structural Clarifications

- Meaning follows perception; it does not precede it
    
- Meaning does not alter continuity; it alters interpretation of continuity
    
- Multiple meanings can be assigned to the same sequence without changing what occurred
    
- Meaning can obscure sequence when it replaces observation with story
    

Meaning is a cognitive activity, not a property of reality.

## Relationship to Core Concepts

- **Coherence** — awareness perceives sequence before meaning is applied
    
- **Fragmentation** — meaning replaces sequence
    
- **Truth** — perception that precedes interpretation
    
- **Control** — attempts to alter meaning instead of addressing sequence
    
- **Responsibility** — awareness of one’s participation before assigning meaning

## Structural Summary

Meaning is how humans make experience understandable to themselves.

> **Meaning is not part of reality’s structure. It is part of the human response to it.**
