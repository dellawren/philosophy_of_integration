**Non-Interference** — the disciplined refusal to enter another person’s causal loop.  
It is the ethical posture of Integration: the choice to remain aligned with cause and effect rather than imposing interpretation, guidance, or correction.

Non-interference is not withdrawal, apathy, or indifference. It is clarity about **agency and positional sovereignty**. Only the person inside an event has access to its truth _and bears responsibility for its consequences_; anyone outside introduces a foreign cause, displaces agency, and slows the natural return of awareness. Non-interference is therefore not passive — it is fidelity to the architecture.

In this philosophy, non-interference honours the self-resolving nature of fragmentation. It preserves the alignment between agency and responsibility, trusts consequence to reveal what the mind cannot, and refuses to distort causal loops with pressure, projection, or moral control.

> **“To interfere is to fragment. To stay outside the loop is to trust reality.”**
