**Victimization** — the persistence of identity organized around a past harm after the original causal event has ended.

Within the framework, victimization begins with a real power imbalance or injury. The initial event is factual. Victimization emerges when the system reorganizes identity, interpretation, and expectation around that event, preserving the role of “harmed one” as a primary orientation.

Victimization is not the harm itself.  
It is the _architecture that remains_ when awareness cannot yet release the story that stabilized the experience.

In this state:

- identity anchors to injury
    
- meaning is derived from moral contrast (innocent / guilty)
    
- agency is deferred or externalized
    
- relational roles stabilize into victim, villain, or rescuer
    

These roles maintain internal coherence at the cost of flexibility. The narrative protects against further harm, but it also constrains participation, choice, and perception.

Victimization persists not because the harm was unreal, but because the chain has not yet reorganized around present awareness.

Victimization dissolves structurally when identity detaches from the narrative and returns to positional awareness within current cause and effect.

### **Framework Notes**

- Victimization is architectural, not moral
    
- It is a stabilization strategy, not a character trait
    
- Ending victimization does not negate harm; it changes orientation
