**Forgiveness** — a post-hoc human interpretation of structural non-engagement.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, forgiveness refers to the human narrative applied after a prior pattern of blame, fault, or moral interpretation toward a past event has ceased to be actively sustained.

Forgiveness is not causal.  
It does not resolve events, repair relationships, absolve actions, or restore trust.  
It does not initiate change or produce coherence.

Forgiveness names the observable absence of continued narrative interference with a completed causal sequence.

What is labeled forgiveness commonly reflects one or more of the following observed changes:

cessation of blame-based interpretation toward a past event

collapse of a recurrent judgment loop

withdrawal of moral framing previously used to sustain attention on the past

increased tolerance for the immutable existence of a completed chain

reduction of mediated narrative input associated with fault or wrongdoing

These changes arise from altered structural conditions, not from forgiveness itself.

When treated as an obligation, forgiveness functions as a teleological overlay that reintroduces distortion by demanding narrative closure or moral resolution. When held descriptively, forgiveness can coexist with the framework as a neutral label for the cessation of blame-driven interference.

Forgiveness does not imply reconciliation, goodness, healing, or maturity.  
It implies only that blame is no longer being used as an active interpretive input.
