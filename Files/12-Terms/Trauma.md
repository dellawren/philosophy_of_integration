**Trauma** — the architectural reorganization that occurs when environmental conditions require the system to shift from participatory regulation into survival regulation in order to remain viable.

Trauma is not defined by the intensity of an event or by the feelings it produces, but by whether the experience forced the system to prioritize survival over participation. When this occurs, the chain does not simply register experience; it reorganizes around protection. Interpretation, emotion, identity, memory, and behaviour are shaped by the need to maintain safety rather than remain engaged with the environment.

This survival-based reorganization becomes part of the architecture of the person. It is not a trait or pathology, but the structure the system built when participation was no longer possible without risk. Because the chain is non-local, these survival architectures influence the chains of others through relational loops and environmental patterning.

In Integration, trauma is understood as architecture, not injury. It is the persistent structure formed when safety could not be assumed. Trauma remains the shape of the chain until awareness allows the system to release survival priority and return to participatory coherence.

> Trauma is not the wound — it is the shape the chain had to take when participation was no longer safe.
