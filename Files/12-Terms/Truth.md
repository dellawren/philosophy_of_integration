> **Truth** — perception of events in sequence before additional narrative, evaluative, or meaning-making interpretation is applied.

Truth, within this framework, is not a claim about objective reality or correctness. It is a temporal description of awareness encountering sequence prior to the overlay of story, judgment, identity, or explanation.

Truth marks the point at which awareness registers what occurred with only the minimal interpretation required for functional perception.

## Structural Clarifications

- Truth does not imply absence of basic perceptual processing
    
- Truth refers to the absence of added narrative beyond what is required to register the event
    
- Truth can be immediately followed by distortion if story replaces observation
    
- Truth is the moment before meaning-making begins

## Structural Summary

Truth is not what is real.  
Truth is the absence of added story at the moment sequence is perceived.

> Truth is a temporal condition in perception, not a metaphysical claim.
