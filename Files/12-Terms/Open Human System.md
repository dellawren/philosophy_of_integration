## **Open Human System**

**Open Human System** — a system in which cause and effect are real but mediated through human perception, narrative, power, and emotion.

Open human systems operate under causal constraints, yet allow for interpretation, substitution, delay, and redirection. Outcomes are not lawless, but they are not pre-scripted. Multiple resolutions remain possible until conditions narrow the field.

Because these systems allow story to intercept consequence, they are adaptable and creative, but also prone to distortion. Morality, identity, and control often appear here as substitutes for unresolved causal movement.

Open human systems are where awareness matters most. Coherence is restored not through enforcement, but through restraint from interference.

> “When story replaces consequence, the system loses its way.”
