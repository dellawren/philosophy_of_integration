**Goodness** refers to the perceived alignment between behaviour and socially approved moral expectations.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, goodness is not a measure of coherence or consequence. It is an evaluative label applied to actions or people based on intention, appearance, or conformity rather than structural effect.

Goodness operates at the level of identity and perception.  
It answers whether an action _looks right_ or _feels acceptable_, not whether it preserves causal integrity.

Goodness can coexist with harm when consequence is obscured by intention or approval.
