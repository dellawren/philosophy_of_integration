> **Judgment** — the act of treating overlay (meaning, evaluation, or narrative) as if it were part of the sequence of events rather than something added to it.

Judgment does not arise from events themselves. It arises when overlay is mistaken for what is occurring.

Judgment is not the presence of preference or opinion. It is the misplacement of those as properties of the event rather than products of interpretation.

### Structural Clarifications

- Judgment operates on overlay, not on sequence
    
- Judgment does not cause overlay; it treats overlay as if it were sequence
    
- Judgment does not change what occurs; it changes how it is experienced
    
- Judgment can be positive or negative; both function the same structurally
    
- When overlay is recognized as overlay, judgment loses structural weight

## Structural Summary

Judgment is overlay mistaken for sequence.
