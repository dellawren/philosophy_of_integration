> **Interpretation** — the minimal cognitive processing required to recognize events, objects, and conditions in sequence so that functional response is possible.

Interpretation in this sense is unavoidable. It allows perception to be usable for action. Without it, events could not be recognized, named, or responded to.

This level of interpretation does not distort sequence. It enables participation within it.

## Overlay Interpretation

> **Overlay Interpretation** — narrative, evaluative, identity-based, or meaning-making interpretation added after functional perception of sequence.

Overlay interpretation is not required for action. It replaces observation with story, judgment, or explanation that is not necessary for participation.

This is the form of interpretation that produces fragmentation and friction.

## Structural Summary

Interpretation allows the system to function.  
Overlay interpretation replaces perception with story.

> The framework concerns itself only with when interpretation becomes overlay.
