**Story Logic** — the interpretive layer that replaces cause and effect with narrative, meaning, identity, and emotional reasoning.

Story logic takes lived experience and turns it into a story about who did what, why it happened, and what it means. It pulls from memory, belief, fear, and preference, creating explanations that feel coherent even when they distort what is actually occurring. Story logic is compelling because it promises understanding without requiring awareness.

Within Integration, story logic is treated as noise rather than information. It is not wrong, but it is unreliable. The story describes the emotional landscape, not the structural truth. Awareness restores coherence by removing the narrative layer and returning the person to the simplicity of cause and effect.

> Story logic distracts; awareness clarifies.
