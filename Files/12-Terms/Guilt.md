**Guilt** — the internalization of responsibility as moral debt.

In the framework, guilt is not the recognition of impact or consequence. It is the belief that harm creates a deficit in worth that must be repaid to restore belonging. Guilt treats responsibility as a transaction rather than a relationship to cause and effect.

Where **shame** collapses identity (“I am wrong”), guilt localizes fault (“I did wrong”) but retains the same underlying distortion: that belonging is conditional and can be lost. As a result, guilt binds awareness to repair narratives, self-punishment, or appeasement rather than to clear participation in consequence.

Guilt differs from responsibility in that it adds moral valuation to effect. Responsibility observes cause and effect without self-condemnation. Guilt converts that observation into internal penalty.

> Guilt is responsibility filtered through moral debt.
