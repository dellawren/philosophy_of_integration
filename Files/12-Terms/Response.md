**Response** — action that arises from within a causal chain after conditions have been fully recognized and coherence restored.

Response is not reactive and not preemptive. It occurs only once narrative has been suspended and responsibility has localized. Rather than attempting to manage outcomes, response aligns action with conditions as they exist.

In a **[[Closed Rule System]]**, response takes the form of compliance, adjustment, or cessation once limits are encountered. In an **[[Open Human System]]**, response preserves causal clarity by acting without displacing responsibility, suppressing feedback, or substituting control for consequence.

Response does not prevent experience.  
It allows experience to inform action.

Within Integration, response is the point at which awareness becomes movement without distortion. It completes chains rather than interrupting them.

> “When clarity replaces urgency, action knows where to land.”
