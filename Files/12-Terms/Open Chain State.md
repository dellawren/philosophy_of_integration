**Open Chain State** — a condition in which a cause–effect sequence has been interrupted, diverted, or mediated before its natural completion.

An open chain continues to generate consequence, but those consequences are no longer resolving the originating cause. Energy remains active in the system because the causal sequence was not allowed to complete.

An open chain is not unfinished due to failure.  
It is unfinished due to **interception**.

**Key characteristics:**

- the original cause remains unresolved
    
- consequence continues without resolution
    
- repetition, escalation, or displacement occurs
    
- secondary chains form to manage residual load
