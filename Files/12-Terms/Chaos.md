**Chaos** — the field of secondary consequences created by interference.  
Chaos is not the product of human freedom but the accumulated side effects of external control.

In Integration, chaos is understood not as randomness or moral breakdown, but as the inevitable turbulence produced when someone attempts to override another person’s causal loop. When control interrupts the natural movement of cause and effect, the loop fragments. Defensive responses multiply. Additional causes stack. The field destabilizes.

Chaos is not inherent to human nature. It is a symptom of interruption.

Chaos emerges when:

- the original cause is prevented from completing
    
- a foreign cause is inserted
    
- awareness is pressured
    
- meaning is imposed
    
- clarity is overridden
    
- consequence is diverted
    

Traditional systems misdiagnose chaos as the reason control is necessary.  
Integration recognizes chaos as the reason control fails.

> Interference does.**
