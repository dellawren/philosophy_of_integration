**Survival Logic** — the internally consistent reasoning produced by a chain operating under threat conditions.

Survival logic is not belief, cognition, or character. It is **architectural reasoning** generated when awareness becomes unavailable and the chain reorganizes around protection. Its function is continuity, not truth.

Within survival logic, perception narrows, options reduce, and behaviour appears constrained or compulsory. The logic presents itself as necessity, morality, loyalty, duty, restraint, sacrifice, or responsibility because those frames stabilize the system under threat. The reasoning feels accurate because it is internally coherent within the distorted architecture that produced it.

Survival logic persists as long as the conditions that required it remain structurally active. When awareness returns and the chain reorients to present conditions, survival logic dissolves without argument or correction. What appeared inevitable becomes optional because the architecture that required it is no longer governing the sequence.

Survival logic is therefore **contextual, temporary, and functional**. It describes how a system reasons while protecting capacity, not how it reasons when coherence is available.

> Survival logic is coherence within threat conditions, not truth within reality.
