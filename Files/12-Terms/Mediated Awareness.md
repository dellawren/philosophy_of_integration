> **Mediated Awareness** — awareness operating through overlay as events are perceived, such that sequence is experienced through narrative, evaluation, meaning-making, or identity rather than directly as sequence.

Mediated awareness is the normal mode of human experience. It is not an error or defect. It is how awareness functions when overlay is primary.

This mediation does not change what occurs. It changes how what occurs is experienced.

### Structural Clarifications

- Overlay operates concurrently with perception
    
- Sequence is encountered through story rather than prior to it
    
- Mediated awareness is a mode of operation, not a psychological condition
    
- As overlay is recognized as overlay, mediation lessens and sequence becomes more apparent
