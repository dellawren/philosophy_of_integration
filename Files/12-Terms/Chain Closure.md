**Chain closure** is the completion of a specific causal sequence once interference is no longer substituting for contact with outcome.

**Explanation**  
A chain closes when an outcome is allowed to land without being buffered, redirected, reframed, accelerated, controlled, or displaced. Nothing further is required to stabilize the experience from that position.

Closure is **local, not global**. It does not mean the environment stops responding, that other people do not react, or that no further events occur. It means the situation finishes _structurally_ for the role and pattern that had been holding it open.

When a chain closes, the energy that was circulating through the pattern dissipates. The impulse to intervene fades. The situation no longer requires attention, effort, or management from the same position.

What follows may be another chain, another person’s pressure, or another system’s response — but it is no longer being maintained by the same interference.

**Key Distinction**  
Chain closure ends a pattern’s involvement, not the movement of life itself.
