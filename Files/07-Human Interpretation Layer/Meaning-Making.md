**Meaning-making** — the human process of constructing explanation, narrative, value, or purpose around events after they have been perceived in sequence.

Meaning-making is a cognitive response to continuity. It does not arise from events themselves, but from the mind’s attempt to render experience understandable, communicable, and personally coherent.

Where **meaning** is the interpretation assigned, **meaning-making** is the activity of assigning it.

### Structural Clarifications

- Meaning-making occurs after perception of sequence
    
- It does not alter cause and effect, only interpretation of it
    
- It can clarify experience when it follows perception
    
- It can distort experience when it replaces perception
    
- It varies across individuals, cultures, and belief systems without changing what occurred
    

When meaning-making occurs, it follows this structural pattern. It is neither correct nor incorrect in itself. Distortion arises only when meaning replaces observation.

### Relationship to the Framework

- Coherence is present when sequence is perceived before meaning-making begins
    
- Fragmentation occurs when meaning-making substitutes for perception
    
- Moral systems, identities, and belief structures are products of meaning-making
    
- Spiritual, philosophical, and psychological narratives largely operate at this layer

### Structural Summary

Meaning-making is how humans live with continuity.

> Meaning-making is not part of reality’s structure. It is part of how humans explain the structure to themselves.
