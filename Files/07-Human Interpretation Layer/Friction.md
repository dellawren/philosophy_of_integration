**Friction** — the experienced tension that arises when meaning, expectation, or narrative conflicts with the sequence of events as they unfold.

Friction is not produced by events themselves. It arises from the interaction between overlay and continuity.

Where sequence proceeds without regard for interpretation, friction is the felt resistance to that continuation.

### Structural Clarifications

- Friction does not exist within cause and effect
    
- Friction is not a property of events
    
- Friction arises when overlay attempts to assert meaning over sequence
    
- Friction disappears when overlay is recognized as overlay, not when events change
    
- Friction can be maintained deliberately; the framework does not assume it should be reduced
    

Friction is experiential, not structural.

### Relationship to the Framework

- **Overlay** produces friction when it conflicts with sequence
    
- **Coherence** removes friction by removing overlay, not by changing events
    
- **Meaning-making** often intensifies friction when treated as reality
    
- The framework describes how friction arises for those who wish to understand it, but does not prescribe its removal

## Structural Summary

Friction is what it feels like when narrative argues with continuity.

> Friction is the human experience of overlay resisting sequence.

---
## Friction Reduction 

Friction reduction is not a goal of the framework. It is a common byproduct when overlay is recognized as overlay.

For those who do not seek relief from friction, the framework offers no directive and makes no recommendation.
