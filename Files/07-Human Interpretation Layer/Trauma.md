## The Phenomenon
Trauma refers to experiences that continue to exert influence long after the originating event has passed.

It is commonly associated with distress, repetition, hypervigilance, emotional flooding, shutdown, or persistent patterns that appear resistant to insight, time, or conscious intent.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Trauma often feels non-causal because the originating cause is no longer present, yet effects continue to arise.

From within lived experience, this creates the impression that:
- the past is intruding on the present
- reactions are disproportionate to current circumstances
- understanding should be sufficient to resolve what persists

This leads to the belief that trauma exists outside [[Causality]] or represents a special category of experience immune to cause and effect.

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, trauma is **stored causal load**.

It forms when an effect cannot complete its causal movement due to interruption, mediation, or displacement, as described by the [[Causal Mediation Principle]].

The chain remains open, and the unresolved load continues to register whenever similar conditions arise.

Trauma is not the original event.  
It is the **unresolved effect** of that event within the chain.

Trauma operates prior to narrative, belief, or identity formation.  
It is architectural, not psychological.

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When trauma is misunderstood or mislocated, several distortions commonly appear:

- trauma is treated as identity rather than a structural condition
- regulation and coping replace causal closure
- moral or character explanations are applied to persistence
- external systems intervene to manage behavior without resolving the chain
- repetition is interpreted as pathology rather than unfinished causality

These distortions often stabilize [[Relational Loop|Relational Loops]] rather than resolve them, allowing trauma to persist while appearing actively addressed.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Psychology and trauma theory accurately document the effects of unresolved experience, including repetition, dysregulation, and altered perception.

Within the framework, these observations correspond to:
- open causal chains
- displaced consequence
- unresolved effect stored within the system

Trauma-informed approaches often prioritize safety, regulation, and harm reduction. These align with [[Self-Protection]] but do not alter the underlying causal architecture unless chain completion occurs.

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not deny suffering or minimize lived experience.  
It does not suggest trauma resolves through insight alone.  
It does not imply blame, fault, or personal failure.

Trauma is not a disorder, an identity, or a moral condition.  
It is a structural result of interrupted causality.

---

## Structural Summary
Trauma persists because a causal chain remains open.  
When trauma is misread as psychological or moral rather than structural, resolution is replaced with management, and the causal load remains.
