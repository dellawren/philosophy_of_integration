### **Cultural Story**

Virtue is framed as moral excellence.  
A virtuous person is disciplined, principled, consistent, and admirable.

Virtue is presented as evidence of trustworthiness and is often associated with leadership, wisdom, and integrity. The cultural claim is that virtuous people are safe people.

### **Effect**

Virtue binds behaviour to identity.

Once virtue becomes an identity anchor:

- deviation is experienced as personal failure
    
- new information is resisted if it threatens self-concept
    
- harmful patterns persist to preserve moral consistency
    
- self-correction becomes psychologically expensive
    

Virtue encourages rigidity in the name of goodness.  
It values being _right_ over being _responsive_.

### **Integrated View**

Within the framework, virtue functions as **moral inertia**.

It stabilizes behaviour even when conditions change.  
This can appear admirable, but it often prevents adaptation when a causal chain shifts.

Ethical action requires situational responsiveness.  
Virtue prioritizes identity continuity instead.

Integration does not reject consistency.  
It rejects consistency that overrides awareness.

A coherent system updates.  
A virtuous identity defends.
