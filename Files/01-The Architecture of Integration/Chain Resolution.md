  description: Defines what it means for a causal chain to reach completion, restoring coherence through direct consequence and integration.

**Chain Resolution** — the condition under which a causal sequence no longer requires continued execution.

Resolution is not improvement, healing, correction, or insight.  
It is a **structural state**.

A chain is resolved when it no longer needs to run in order to maintain coherence.

## What Resolution Is

Resolution means:

- the sustaining conditions of the chain are no longer present
    
- the chain no longer provides functional advantage
    
- continued execution offers no regulatory benefit
    

Resolution does not imply disappearance.  
It implies **non-necessity**.

---

## What Resolution Is Not

Resolution is not:

- emotional completion
    
- behavioural change
    
- conscious understanding
    
- identity transformation
    
- moral reckoning
    

These may occur as effects, but they do not define resolution.

Resolution is architectural, not experiential.

## Resolution and Execution

A resolved chain:

- may still be remembered
    
- may still be describable
    
- may still be referenced
    

But it no longer:

- loops
    
- predicts
    
- constrains choice
    
- shapes interpretation
    
- consumes load
    

Execution ceases because **nothing requires it**.

---

## Relation to Closing and Replacement

Resolution is the **precondition** for both outcomes.

- **Closing** describes completion of a sequence.
    
- **Replacement** describes redundancy via a new architecture.
    

Resolution describes **why either can occur**.

No chain is replaced without resolution.  
No chain closes without resolution.

---

## Constraint Summary

- Resolution is structural, not psychological.
    
- It cannot be forced.
    
- It cannot be accelerated by insight.
    
- It occurs only when conditions change.
    

> **A chain resolves when it is no longer required to function.**
