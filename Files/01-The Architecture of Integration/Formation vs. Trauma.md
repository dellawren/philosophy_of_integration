Not all persistent patterning within the chain reflects trauma.

The chain naturally forms relational patterns through repeated exposure to environment. This process of formation and persistence is part of ordinary development and does not require survival regulation.

Trauma occurs only when environmental conditions require the system to shift from participatory regulation into survival regulation in order to remain viable. This condition is defined as [[Overload]].

> Formation + persistence = relational pattern  
> Formation + persistence + overload = trauma

This distinction is structural, not emotional. Many behaviours associated with trauma, such as vigilance, suppression, or guardedness, can also arise through ordinary relational formation. What differentiates trauma is not the behaviour itself, but whether participation was replaced by survival regulation during formation.
