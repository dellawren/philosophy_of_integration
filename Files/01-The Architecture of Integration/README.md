## Chain Architecture (Overview)

This framework describes the **mechanics of human experience** as a cause-and-effect system.  
It does not offer guidance, ethics, meaning, or instruction.  
It describes **what happens**, not **what should happen**.

All notes in this section answer one or more of the following structural questions.

---

## What is a chain?

A **chain** is the minimal architecture through which experience unfolds:

**Cause → Effect → Awareness → Choice → Next Cause**

A chain is not psychological, moral, or symbolic.  
It is the structural sequence through which reality moves inside a human system.

Every experience runs on a chain.  
There are no exceptions.

→ See {{Chain Architecture}}

---

## How does cause and effect move through a chain?

Cause initiates.  
Effect registers automatically through biology and perception.  
Awareness may or may not be available.  
Choice only exists if awareness is present.

When awareness is absent, the chain does not stop.  
It reroutes.

Cause and effect are continuous, not instructional.  
They do not reward or punish.

→ See {{Cause and Effect}}

---

## Where does distortion enter?

Distortion enters **only** when awareness is unavailable at the moment effect registers.

The chain bends to continue functioning under constraint.  
This bend becomes architecture.

Distortion is not error or pathology.  
It is a structural adaptation.

→ See {{Distorted Chain}}  
→ See {{Threat Prediction}}

---

## How does awareness function structurally?

Awareness is not insight, intention, or reflection.  
It is a **structural capacity** to perceive effect without collapsing into it.

When awareness is present, the chain completes cleanly.  
When absent, distortion substitutes.

Awareness cannot be forced.  
It becomes available when threat prediction drops.

→ See {{Structural Awareness}}  
→ See {{Threat Prediction}}

---

## How does time behave inside a chain?

Time is not linear inside the chain.  
It reflects the architecture of the chain currently running.

- Coherent chains produce linear time.
    
- Distorted chains produce circular or collapsed time.
    

Time distortion is an effect, not a belief.

→ See {{Temporal Architecture}}  
→ See {{Circular Time}}

---

## How does a chain close?

A chain closes when:

- awareness meets the original cause
    
- effect completes without interruption
    
- interpretation no longer distorts
    
- memory loses charge
    

Closure is not an act.  
It is a consequence.

→ See {{Closing the Chain}}  
→ See {{Chain Resolution}}

---

## How does replacement occur?

Replacement occurs **after** a chain closes.

A new chain forms automatically under present conditions.  
The system orients toward it because it requires less energy.

Distorted chains are not repaired.  
They become obsolete.

→ See {{Replacement}}

---

## What makes a chain persist?

A chain persists when:

- threat prediction remains active
    
- awareness is unavailable
    
- secondary chains carry load
    
- memory remains charged
    
- identity stabilizes distortion
    

Persistence is mechanical, not psychological.

→ See {{Secondary Chains}}  
→ See {{Memory as Architecture}}

---

## What makes a chain obsolete?

A chain becomes obsolete when:

- its protective function is no longer required
    
- awareness can hold the original cause
    
- consequence no longer predicts threat
    

Obsolescence is silent.  
Nothing is dismantled.
