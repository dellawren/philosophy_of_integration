**Chain completion** — the point at which a causal sequence exhausts its sustaining conditions and no longer executes.

A chain does not terminate through interruption, opposition, insight, or decision.  
It completes when the conditions required for its continued execution are no longer present.

Completion is not corrective.  
It is **structural finality**.

Once complete, a chain no longer produces effects, predictions, or regulatory demand.

---

## **Execution vs. Completion**

A chain may become observable before it completes.  
Observability does not alter execution.

Execution persists while:

- sustaining conditions remain intact
    
- predictive accuracy remains sufficient
    
- regulatory function is still required
    

Completion occurs only when these conditions fail simultaneously.

A visible chain may still be fully active.

---

## **Mid-Sequence Persistence**

What is commonly described as “stuckness” corresponds to **mid-sequence execution**.

At this stage:

- the chain is executing
    
- effects are still propagating
    
- regulatory demand remains present
    

This state is not pathological or exceptional.  
It indicates that the causal sequence has not yet exhausted its function.

Interference at this stage increases persistence by preventing discharge.

---

## **Structural Markers of Completion**

The following markers may be observed as effects of completion.  
They are **descriptive**, not causal.

### **Predictive Collapse**

The chain’s internal predictions no longer match present conditions.

Execution cost increases.  
Regulatory efficiency decreases.

---

### **Support Structure Deactivation**

Secondary chains and auxiliary regulatory mechanisms disengage automatically as load drops.

This deactivation:

- is not initiated
    
- is not managed
    
- is not sequential
    

Support structures disengage because their function is no longer required.

---

### **Effect Discharge**

Residual effects propagate without substitution or buffering.

Once discharge completes, no further propagation occurs.

Avoidance prolongs execution.  
Non-interference allows completion.

---

### **Memory Neutralization**

Records of the sequence persist without charge or predictive weight.

Memory remains informational but no longer participates in execution.

This indicates that the chain is no longer active.

---

## **Completion and Replacement**

Completion does not imply absence.

Once a chain completes, **new causal sequences may emerge** under present conditions.

These sequences are not continuations.  
They are not repairs.  
They are not modifications.

They are independent architectures formed in a different condition set.

Replacement is therefore an **effect of completion**, not a mechanism of closure.

---

## **Failure Modes**

Chains that are interrupted but not completed tend to:

- resume execution
    
- reappear under altered conditions
    
- recruit new secondary structures
    

Incomplete execution preserves predictive demand.

Completion requires **full discharge without interference**.

---

## **Canonical Summary**

- Chains complete when sustaining conditions fail
    
- Visibility does not equal completion
    
- Support structures disengage automatically
    
- Memory persists without execution
    
- Replacement follows completion, not effort
    

> A chain does not end because it is opposed.  
> It ends because it has finished executing.
