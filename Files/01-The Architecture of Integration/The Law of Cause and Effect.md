**Law of Cause and Effect** — the foundational constraint governing all chain execution.

Cause and effect describe **continuity**, not meaning, justice, instruction, or correction.  
A cause produces an effect according to existing conditions and architecture.  
Nothing more is added. Nothing is evaluated.

Cause and effect are **relational**, not moral.

## Structural Claims

- Cause is not chosen.
    
- Effect is not deserved.
    
- Consequence is not communicative.
    
- Continuation is not intentional.
    

Cause and effect do not:

- teach lessons
    
- reward or punish
    
- enforce balance
    
- correct behaviour
    
- respond to belief
    

They only **propagate structure forward**.

---

## Directionality

Cause and effect are **directional in execution**, not in meaning.

- A cause precedes an effect.
    
- An effect cannot retroactively alter its cause.
    
- Later awareness does not change earlier execution.
    
- Interpretation does not modify causal flow.
    

Architecture determines outcome, not reflection.

---

## Relation to Chains

Within chain architecture:

- Cause initiates a sequence.
    
- Effect is the automatic continuation.
    
- Awareness may or may not enter.
    
- Choice may or may not become available.
    

Cause and effect operate **regardless** of awareness.

Awareness observes the chain.  
It does not suspend causality.

---

## Constraint Summary

- Cause and effect are mechanical.
    
- They are non-negotiable.
    
- They do not adapt to preference.
    
- They do not bend for insight.
    

> **Cause and effect describe what continues — not why it should.**
