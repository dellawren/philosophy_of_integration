Della Wren (also known as Laura Bungarz) is an independent writer and systems thinker working at the intersection of philosophy, causality, and human experience.

The Philosophy of Integration is an original ontological framework developed outside of academic institutions. It draws on philosophical traditions, systems thinking, and sustained inquiry into cause and effect, without allegiance to religious, political, or therapeutic models.

This work is not affiliated with a university, organization, or movement. It is published independently and remains open to critique, dialogue, and further development.

Della’s writing appears here, in long-form essays, and in selected publications. She does not maintain a public persona across social media platforms.
