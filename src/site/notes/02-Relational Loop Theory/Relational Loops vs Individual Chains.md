  og:title: "Relational Loops vs Individual Chains"
  description: Clarifies the difference between individual causal chains and relational loops, showing how loops exist in the relationship itself rather than within either person.

**Relational Loops vs Individual Chains** establishes a structural boundary between **independent causal sequences** and **coupled causal systems**.

This distinction prevents category errors in analysis, correction, and attribution of responsibility.

---

### **Individual Chains**

Individual chains:

- resolve through direct consequence
    
- close independently
    
- do not require shared restructuring
    

Closure occurs locally through causal return.

See [[Chain Resolution]].

---

### **Relational Loops**

Relational loops:

- require system-level closure conditions
    
- cannot resolve through unilateral or individual action
    
- persist under isolated intervention
    

Closure requires redistribution or completion of **shared load**.

See [[Coupled Chains and Shared Load]] and [[Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops]].

---

### **Category Error Prevention**

Applying individual-chain logic to relational loops produces:

- ineffective correction
    
- misapplied responsibility
    
- increased persistence through structural mismatch
    

Responsibility misfires when the level of causality is misidentified.

See [[Why Insight Doesn't Break Loops]].

### **Relation to Mediation**

Relational loops often arise under mediated conditions.

- individual consequence is displaced
    
- closure is structurally unavailable
    
- persistence follows mechanically
    

See [[Systemic Interference]] and [[Causal Mediation Principle]].

### **Scope Note**

This note defines **a structural distinction**, not a moral one.

It does not explain:

- blame or fault
    
- motivation or intent
    
- behavioral compliance
    

Those interpretations belong outside the mechanics layer.
