**Relational Loop Decay** describes the gradual dissolution of a relational loop through **entropy, weakened coupling, or external load completion**.

Relational loops rarely terminate through rupture.  
They **decay**.

---

### **Structural Conditions of Decay**

Decay occurs when:

- reinforcement of coupling diminishes
    
- structural interdependence weakens over time
    
- unresolved load completes outside the relational structure
    
- the relational container is no longer required to hold continuity
    

Decay is not an event.  
It is a **process of structural unwinding**.

---

### **Entropy and Unwinding**

As reinforcement decreases:

- load disperses rather than concentrates
    
- repetition loses coherence
    
- persistence weakens without intervention
    

The loop does not break.  
It **loses structural necessity**.

Most relational loops end quietly through entropy, not intervention.

---

### **Relation to Decoupling**

Decay often follows partial or progressive decoupling.

- coupling weakens incrementally
    
- load redistributes gradually
    
- destabilization resolves through dissipation rather than collapse
    

See [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Load Redistribution Under Decoupling\|Load Redistribution Under Decoupling]].

---

### **Relation to Resolution**

Decay is distinct from resolution.

- decay unwinds persistence
    
- resolution completes causal chains
    

Some loops dissolve without full closure.  
Others require explicit completion.

Resolution conditions are defined in [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops\|Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops]].

---

### **Scope Note**

This note explains **how relational loops end structurally over time**.

It does not explain:

- intervention strategies
    
- experiential closure
    
- healing or growth narratives
    

Those belong outside the mechanics layer.
