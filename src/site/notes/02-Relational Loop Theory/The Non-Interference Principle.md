Relational Loop Theory describes how causal chains remain available through relationship when consequence cannot return cleanly to its source.

The Non-Interference Principle does not alter, manage, or resolve these loops.  
It describes the absence of additional causal input.

In a non-teleological system, non-interference does not produce correction.  
It simply allows existing structural conditions to remain visible.

Persistent distorted chains do not continue _because_ interference occurs.  
They continue because the conditions that sustain them remain present.

Non-interference does not destabilize a distorted loop.  
It removes secondary distortion created by attempted correction.

When interference occurs:

- new mediated chains are introduced
    
- responsibility becomes diffused
    
- relational load increases
    
- the loop becomes harder to read
    

When interference ceases:

- no new structure is added
    
- no resolution is guaranteed
    
- the loop does not “work itself out”
    
- but the chain becomes legible without additional noise
    

Relational Loop Theory explains **persistence**.  
Non-Interference explains **why persistence does not worsen without added input**.

Together, they describe a system where:

- loops do not self-correct
    
- distortion does not escalate unless compounded
    
- coherence does not heal
    
- and clarity does not force change
    

Structural change occurs only when different conditions become present.  
Non-interference does not create those conditions.  
It prevents obscuring them.
