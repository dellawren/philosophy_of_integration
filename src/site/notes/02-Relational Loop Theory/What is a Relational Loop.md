  og:title: "What Is a Relational Loop"
  description: Defines a relational loop as a structural condition formed when causal consequence between actors cannot complete, causing interaction to repeat without resolution.

**Relational Loop** — a structural condition in which two or more causal chains become coupled and unable to resolve independently due to shared unresolved load.

A relational loop is not an interaction pattern, emotional dynamic, or behavioral habit.  
It is a **shared causal configuration**.

A loop exists when:

- causal closure cannot occur within a single chain
    
- consequence is distributed across multiple actors
    
- resolution requires change at the relational level
    

The loop resides **between chains**, not within them.

This distinction prevents category errors between relational structures and individual causality.

### **Scope and Boundaries**

This note defines **what a relational loop is**.

It does **not** explain:

- how loops behave over time → see [[Relational Loop Mechanics]]
    
- how chains become coupled → see [[Coupled Chains and Shared Load]]
    
- how relational loops differ from individual causality → see [[Relational Loops vs Individual Chains]]
    
- how mediation disrupts closure → see [[Systemic Interference]]
