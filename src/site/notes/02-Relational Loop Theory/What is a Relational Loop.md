**Relational Loop** — a structural condition in which two or more causal chains become coupled and unable to resolve independently due to shared unresolved load.

A relational loop is not an interaction pattern, emotional dynamic, or behavioral habit.  
It is a **shared causal configuration**.

A loop exists when:

- causal closure cannot occur within a single chain
    
- consequence is distributed across multiple actors
    
- resolution requires change at the relational level
    

The loop resides **between chains**, not within them.

This distinction prevents category errors between relational structures and individual causality.
