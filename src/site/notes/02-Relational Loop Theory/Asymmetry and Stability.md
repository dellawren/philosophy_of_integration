**Asymmetry and Stability** describes the relationship between **unequal load distribution** and **structural persistence** within coupled causal systems.

Relational loops persist longest when unresolved load is **distributed asymmetrically** across chains.

---

### **Structural Definition**

An **asymmetric loop** is a coupled causal configuration in which unresolved load is carried unevenly between participating chains.

Asymmetric loops are structurally stable because:

- one chain carries less unresolved consequence
    
- another chain absorbs disproportionate load
    
- redistribution would destabilize the existing equilibrium
    

Stability emerges from **containment efficiency**, not from resolution.

---

### **Stability vs Coherence**

Structural stability does not indicate coherence.

- Stable loops may persist indefinitely
    
- Persistent loops may remain unresolved
    
- Containment may improve while closure remains impossible
    

Stability reflects how effectively load is held,  
not whether causality has completed.

This distinction prevents misinterpretation of persistence as health or balance.

---

### **Resistance to Change**

Highly asymmetric loops resist change because:

- altering load distribution threatens equilibrium
    
- redistribution produces destabilization
    
- the system favors persistence over reconfiguration
    

Pressure applied without closure conditions increases stabilization rather than resolution.

---

### **Relation to Coupling and Load**

Asymmetry is a property of **coupled chains**, not individual actors.

- load distribution emerges after coupling
    
- asymmetry increases persistence
    
- resolution requires redistribution or completion
    

See [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Coupled Chains and Shared Load\|Coupled Chains and Shared Load]].

---

### **Relation to Decoupling and Decay**

When asymmetric loops destabilize:

- load redistribution occurs abruptly
    
- destabilization follows mechanically
    
- decay or reconfiguration may begin
    

These processes are described in [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Load Redistribution Under Decoupling\|Load Redistribution Under Decoupling]] and [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Relational Loop Decay\|Relational Loop Decay]].

### **Scope Note**

This note explains **why unequal load distribution increases loop persistence**.

It does not explain:

- how asymmetry forms → see [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Coupled Chains and Shared Load\|Coupled Chains and Shared Load]]
    
- how resolution occurs → see [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops\|Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops]]
    
- human experience of imbalance or dependency
