**Load Redistribution Under Decoupling** — the structural destabilization that occurs when a coupled causal configuration loses one of its load-bearing components.

This process is not experiential.  
It is **mechanical rebalancing** within a coupled system.

---

### **Structural Description**

When a relational loop undergoes decoupling:

- shared unresolved load is redistributed across the remaining structure
    
- existing equilibrium conditions destabilize
    
- unresolved causal continuity seeks an alternative structural container
    

No absence is required.  
No intent is involved.

The change occurs because **load-bearing capacity has shifted**.

---

### **Destabilization Dynamics**

Coupled systems maintain stability through distributed load.

When coupling weakens or collapses:

- prior stability conditions no longer hold
    
- compensatory structures strain or reorganize
    
- secondary chains may intensify or proliferate
    

Destabilization is not a signal.  
It is an **inevitable outcome of structural change**.

---

### **Clarification**

This process is often misinterpreted as:

- dependency
    
- loss
    
- withdrawal
    
- dysfunction
    

These interpretations belong to the human layer.

Architecturally, what occurs is **load redistribution following decoupling**.

---

### **Relation to Loop Mechanics**

- Decoupling does not resolve a loop
    
- It alters how unresolved load is carried
    
- Resolution requires closure, not redistribution
    

This distinction prevents misattribution of cause.

### **Scope Note**

This note describes **structural behavior under decoupling conditions**.

- No actor perspective is assumed
    
- No experiential language is implied
    
- Human interpretation is intentionally excluded
