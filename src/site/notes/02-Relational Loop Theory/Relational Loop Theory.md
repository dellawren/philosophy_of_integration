**Relational Loop Theory** describes the formation, persistence, and resolution constraints of **coupled causal chains** under mediated or unresolved conditions.

A relational loop is not a psychological dynamic and not an emotional condition.  
It is a **structural condition** created when causality between chain actors cannot complete.

The loop exists **in the relational structure itself**, not within any individual chain actor.

---

### **Conditions of Formation**

Relational loops form when:

- causal consequence between actors is interrupted
    
- mediation enters between relational cause and effect
    
- responsibility is structurally displaced
    
- resolution is replaced with regulation, correction, or management
    

These conditions do not alter causality.  
They **redirect it**.

The loop is not emotional.  
It is architectural.

Formation mechanics are further detailed in [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Systemic Interference\|Systemic Interference]] and formalized by the [[12-Terms/Causal Mediation Principle\|Causal Mediation Principle]].

### **Structural Description**

Relational loops are **mediated chains spanning multiple actors**.

At a high level, the structure is:

1. One chain actor initiates a causal action
    
2. A second chain actor registers an effect
    
3. An intermediary structure intercepts the relational chain
    
4. Consequence is displaced away from the originating relation
    
5. The relational chain remains open
    
6. Interaction repeats under altered surface conditions
    

The unresolved chain embeds itself in the relationship, which becomes the **container for persistence**.

What repeats is not the event.  
What repeats is the **unclosed structure**.

---

### **Key Structural Insight**

Relational loops do not persist because of misunderstanding, emotion, or lack of insight.

They persist because:

- consequence does not return to its point of origin
    
- relational chains are prevented from closing
    
- mediation absorbs what relationships require to resolve
    

> Relationships do not loop because people feel too much.  
> They loop because causality has nowhere to land.

The behavioral persistence that follows is mechanical, not motivational.

---

### **On Resolution and Replacement**

Relational loops do not dissolve through negotiation, insight, or behavioral agreement.

They resolve only when:

- mediation withdraws from the relational chain
    
- consequence is allowed to complete relationally
    
- closure occurs at the level of interaction
    
- no external structure substitutes for resolution
    

Replacement, reconfiguration, or separation may occur **after closure**,  
but cannot produce closure themselves.

Resolution conditions are defined structurally in [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops\|Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops]].

### **Scope Note**

This note defines the **conceptual scope** of Relational Loop Theory.

It **does explain**:

- what relational loops are
    
- how loops form under mediation
    
- why loops persist structurally
    
- how loops relate to systems and causal mediation
    

It **does not explain**:

- mechanical loop behavior → see [[02-Relational Loop Theory/Relational Loop Mechanics\|Relational Loop Mechanics]]
    
- positional system occupation → see [[02-Relational Loop Theory/System as Chain Actor\|System as Chain Actor]]
    
- mediation law → see [[12-Terms/Causal Mediation Principle\|Causal Mediation Principle]]
    

These distinctions prevent category errors and preserve architectural coherence.
