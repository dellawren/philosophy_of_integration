**Relational Loop Mechanics** describes the **structural behavior of relational loops once coupling has occurred**.

This note does not explain why relational loops form.  
It defines **how coupled causal chains behave under unresolved load**, independent of psychology, emotion, intent, or meaning.

Relational loop mechanics are architectural properties of **coupled chains**, not experiential phenomena.

---

### **What This Layer Covers**

The mechanics layer explains:

- how causal chains become structurally interdependent
    
- how unresolved load is distributed across coupled systems
    
- why loops stabilize, resist change, and persist over time
    
- how destabilization, decay, and resolution occur mechanically
    

These behaviors follow from structure alone.

### **Mechanical Dimensions**

Relational loop mechanics are described across the following dimensions:

- **Coupling and Load Sharing**  
    How independent chains become interdependent  
    → see [[Coupled Chains and Shared Load]]
    
- **Asymmetry and Persistence**  
    Why unequal load distribution increases stability  
    → see [[Asymmetry and Stability]]
    
- **Load Redistribution Under Decoupling**  
    Structural destabilization following weakened coupling  
    → see [[Load Redistribution Under Decoupling]]
    
- **Cognitive Non-Substitution**  
    Why awareness does not alter loop behavior  
    → see [[Why Insight Doesn't Break Loops]]
    
- **Resolution Conditions**  
    The structural requirements for closure or reconfiguration  
    → see [[Resolution Conditions for Relational Loops]]
    
- **Boundary Distinction**  
    Why relational loops cannot be treated as individual chains  
    → see [[Relational Loops vs Individual Chains]]
    
- **Entropy and Unwinding**  
    How loops decay without rupture or intervention  
    → see [[Relational Loop Decay]]

### **What This Layer Does Not Cover**

This note does **not** address:

- loop formation → see [[Relational Loop Theory]]
    
- mediation or interference → see [[Systemic Interference]]
    
- system occupation of chains → see [[System as Chain Actor]]
    
- causal law governing mediation → see [[Causal Mediation Principle]]
    
- human experience or interpretation
    

These exclusions are structural, not incidental.

---

### **Scope Note**

Relational Loop Mechanics operates entirely within **architectural causality**.

- No actor perspective is assumed
    
- No behavioral explanation is offered
    
- No moral or social interpretation is permitted
    

This preserves mechanical coherence and prevents category errors.
