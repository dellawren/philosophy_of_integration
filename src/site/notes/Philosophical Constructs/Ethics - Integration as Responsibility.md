## Type
Philosophical Construct  

---

## Principle  
[[Terms/Responsibility\|Responsibility]] is the natural expression of awareness — not a [[Terms/Morality\|moral]] duty, but an energetic coherence with truth.  

---

## Description  
In traditional systems, ethics are rule-based — an attempt to impose order through obedience. [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] redefines ethics as participation in cause and effect.  
When we understand ourselves as part of the whole, responsibility ceases to be obligation. It becomes alignment: the choice to move with awareness rather than against it.  

[[Terms/Ethics\|Ethics]] in Integration are not enforced by consequence; they *are* consequence. Awareness itself regulates behaviour more faithfully than punishment ever could.  

---

## Implications  
When morality dissolves, responsibility deepens. We no longer act to avoid guilt or seek reward — we act because we understand the effect of our presence. This restores integrity without requiring virtue.  

---

## Reflective Line  
> “Responsibility is not control — it is coherence remembered.”
