## Type
Philosophical Construct  

---

## Principle  
If it were against some universal law, it would not be mirrored in the animal kingdom.  

---

## Description  
The universe does not contradict itself.  
Nature operates through function, not morality — through correction, not punishment. Every pattern that repeats across the living world exists because it serves coherence, even when human preference calls it “wrong.”  

Human morality mistakes discomfort for disorder. It adds narrative to consequence and calls it virtue. But coherence predates conscience. Nature does not moralize; it regulates.  

---

## Implications  
The Law of Natural [[Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]] dissolves the illusion of human exceptionalism. It reminds us that morality is not a cosmic truth but a cultural choice.  
When awareness replaces judgment, ethics re-aligns with consequence — choice becomes participation, not resistance.  

---

## Reflective Line  
> “Nature does not break its own code. Truth can be measured by its ability to exist without permission.”
