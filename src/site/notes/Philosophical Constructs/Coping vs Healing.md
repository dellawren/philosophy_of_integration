**Cultural Story**  
Coping is treated as progress. If you can manage your triggers, regulate your emotions, avoid breakdowns, and “stay positive,” you’re seen as healing. Society praises resilience, emotional control, and the ability to function despite pain — as if endurance is the same as transformation.

---

**Effect**  
Coping maintains the wound. It keeps people surviving instead of resolving what hurts. Coping creates skillful armour — spiritual practices, mindset tools, emotional regulation techniques — that help a person _stay in the life that caused the pain_, rather than freeing them from it. It delays healing by making suffering more bearable.

---

**Integrated View**  
Healing doesn’t make pain manageable — it makes pain unnecessary.  
Healing asks us to look at the wound directly, understand it, and release the story that keeps it alive. It removes the need for coping altogether. Healing restores wholeness, making self-protection irrelevant.

Coping is the bridge to keep you safe long enough to heal — it is not the healing itself.

> Coping lets you carry the load. Healing lets you put it down.
