### _The Two Streams of Movement That Shape a Life_

**Cause** is anything that initiates movement in the chain of experience.  
In Integration, cause appears in two distinct streams:

- the causes that shape us
    
- the causes we generate
    

Understanding both is essential for coherence, responsibility, freedom, and integration.

---

## **External Cause**

_What arises from the world._

External causes are movements that originate outside the self and act upon experience.  
These include events, conditions, relationships, environments, systems, and the physical world.

**External cause includes:**

- childhood environment
    
- structural forces
    
- relational dynamics
    
- loss, shock, or tragedy
    
- illness or injury
    
- economic or political constraint
    
- other people’s behaviour
    
- anything the world does that impacts us
    

External cause is:

- not chosen
    
- not controllable
    
- not personal
    
- not moral
    
- not instructional
    
- often overwhelming
    
- always consequential
    

External cause shapes the conditions the self must respond within.  
It sets the stage — not the script.

---

## **Internal Cause**

_What arises from within._

Internal causes are movements generated by the self:  
thoughts, emotions, impulses, patterns, memories, interpretations, protections, and reactions.

**Internal cause includes:**

- a sudden emotion
    
- an activating memory
    
- a protective thought
    
- a withdrawal
    
- a projection or assumption
    
- a nervous system pattern
    
- a moment of clarity
    
- the decision to speak or stay silent
    

Internal cause is:

- not always chosen
    
- not always conscious
    
- shaped by history, biology, and nervous system
    
- deeply influential
    
- the beginning of personal responsibility (without moral judgment)
    

From the moment we exist, we begin generating causes.  
This does not make us blameworthy — it makes us participants.

---

## **The Meeting Point: Effect**

We do not choose the cause — internal or external.  
The cause is already in motion by the time awareness arrives.

**Freedom appears only in the effect:**

- in how we meet what arises
    
- in the space between reaction and choice
    
- in the bandwidth of what becomes possible next
    

External cause shapes conditions.  
Internal cause shapes patterns.  
Freedom shapes the next movement.

## **The Self as Both Cause and Effect**

Every human life unfolds as a continuous exchange:

- the world acts on us → external cause
    
- we respond and create new movement → internal cause
    
- the world responds to our movement → new external cause
    
- awareness shapes the effect → internal cause again
    

We are shaped by what we did not choose,  
and we shape reality through what arises within us.

This duality is the foundation of natural responsibility—not moral duty, but relational consequence.

## **How Integration Works With Both Causes**

### **Coherence**

- With external cause: seeing what happened without story.
    
- With internal cause: seeing what arose without identification.
    

### **Distortion**

- With external cause: misreading reality.
    
- With internal cause: misreading self.
    

### **Truth**

- With external cause: contact with reality.
    
- With internal cause: contact with experience.
    

### **Responsibility**

- With external cause: responsible within conditions.
    
- With internal cause: responsible for effects.
    

### **Freedom**

- With external cause: bandwidth inside constraint.
    
- With internal cause: openness inside response.
    

### **Integration**

- With external cause: meeting circumstance cleanly.
    
- With internal cause: meeting self cleanly.

## **Unified Statement**

> **Every person lives inside two streams of cause:  
> the causes that shape them, and the causes they generate.
> 
> External cause creates the conditions of a life.  
> Internal cause creates the movements that continue it.
> 
> We do not choose the cause — we choose how to meet the effect.  
> Freedom lives in that meeting.  
> Integration begins there.**
