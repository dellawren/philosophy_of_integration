### _The Two Streams of Movement That Shape a Life_

**Cause** is anything that initiates movement in the chain of experience.  
In Integration, cause expresses itself through two distinct streams:

- **the causes that shape us**
    
- **the causes we generate**
    

Understanding both is essential for coherence, freedom, natural responsibility, and integration — **without implying that any response is required**.

---

# **External Cause**

### _What arises from the world._

External causes originate outside the self and move through experience.  
They are the conditions we inherit, encounter, or collide with — the reality we did not choose but must meet.

**External cause includes:**

- childhood environment
    
- cultural, structural, or systemic forces
    
- relational dynamics
    
- loss, shock, change, or tragedy
    
- illness, injury, or physical limitation
    
- economic or political constraint
    
- other people’s actions or behaviour
    
- anything the world does that impacts us
    

External cause is:

- not chosen
    
- not controllable
    
- not personal
    
- not moral
    
- not a lesson
    
- often overwhelming
    
- always consequential
    

External cause sets **conditions**, not commands.  
It shapes the moment — **not the required response to it**.

---

# **Internal Cause**

### _What arises within._

Internal causes originate from the self — from the nervous system, memory, biology, temperament, history, and consciousness.

**Internal cause includes:**

- sudden emotion
    
- an activating memory
    
- a protective thought or impulse
    
- withdrawal or shutdown
    
- a projection or assumption
    
- a nervous system pattern
    
- a moment of clarity
    
- the choice to act or the choice to be still
    

Internal cause is:

- not always chosen
    
- not always conscious
    
- shaped by history and nervous system
    
- deeply influential
    
- the basis of natural responsibility (never moral duty)
    

From the moment we exist, we generate causes.  
This does not make us guilty — it makes us **participants**.

---

# **The Meeting Point: Effect**

### _Freedom appears only here._

We do not choose the cause — internal or external.  
By the time awareness arrives, the cause is already in motion.

**Effect is where freedom appears:**

- in how we meet what arises
    
- in the space between reaction and choice
    
- in the bandwidth of what becomes possible next
    
- in the option to move, or the option not to
    

Nothing in the architecture requires a response.  
**Freedom is non-directive.**  
Coherence returns with or without action.

External cause shapes conditions.  
Internal cause shapes patterns.  
**Freedom shapes orientation.**

---

# **The Self as Both Cause and Effect**

### _The ongoing exchange._

Every human life unfolds as a continuous relational loop:

- the world acts → external cause
    
- we respond → internal cause
    
- the world responds to us → new external cause
    
- awareness interprets → internal cause again
    

We are shaped by forces we did not choose,  
and we shape reality through everything that arises within us.

This duality forms the foundation of **natural responsibility** —  
not moral obligation, but the simple fact that we live inside the effects we create.

---

# **How Integration Works With Both Causes**

### **Coherence**

- With external cause: seeing what happened without story.
    
- With internal cause: seeing what arose without identification.
    

### **Distortion**

- With external cause: misreading reality.
    
- With internal cause: misreading self.
    

### **Truth**

- With external cause: direct contact with reality.
    
- With internal cause: direct contact with experience.
    

### **Responsibility**

- With external cause: responsibility _within_ conditions.
    
- With internal cause: responsibility _for_ effects.
    

### **Freedom**

- With external cause: bandwidth inside constraint.
    
- With internal cause: openness inside response.
    

### **Integration**

- With external cause: meeting circumstance cleanly.
    
- With internal cause: meeting self cleanly.
    

Nothing in this list implies a required behaviour.  
These are descriptions of movement — not instructions.

# **Unified Statement**

> **Every person lives inside two streams of cause:  
> the causes that shape them, and the causes they generate.
> 
> External cause creates the conditions of a life.  
> Internal cause creates the movements that continue it.
> 
> We do not choose the cause — we choose how to meet the effect.  
> Freedom lives in that meeting.  
> Integration begins there.**
