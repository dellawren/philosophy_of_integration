## **Principle**

Reflection is how truth reveals itself through consequence.  
What is created must be seen — not to punish or correct, but to complete the movement of coherence.

---
## **Description**

The **Law of Reflection** is the foundation beneath [[Terms/Cause and Effect\|Cause and Effect]].  
It states that every movement of awareness generates an image of itself — a mirrored response through which reality confirms what has been set in motion.

In the system of [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]], reflection is not feedback from a moral universe but from a coherent one.  
Reality does not “respond” to us as reward or retribution; it mirrors our current level of alignment.  
What we call experience is the visible surface of that reflection.

This law dissolves the illusion of separation between action and outcome.  
Cause and effect are not linear opposites but one continuous curve — awareness meeting itself through time.

---
## **Implications**

The Law of Reflection transforms the way we interpret consequence.  
It removes blame from the field, revealing that life does not happen _to_ us or _for_ us — it happens _through_ us.

When we see reality as reflection, defensiveness gives way to curiosity.  
Pain becomes information; contradiction becomes clarity.  
It dissolves fragmentation by returning perception to participation: everything we encounter is the echo of our own movement within a larger coherence.

In ethical or societal terms, this law exposes how moral systems misread consequence as judgment.  
Integration replaces that with observation — the willingness to see what is being shown without shame or control.
