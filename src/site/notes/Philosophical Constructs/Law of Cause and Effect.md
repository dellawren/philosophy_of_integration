## **Principle**

Everything that exists participates in consequence.  
Nothing occurs without cause, and no cause fails to create an effect — whether immediate or delayed, visible or unseen.

---
## **Description**

The **Law of Cause and Effect** is the foundational rhythm of reality.  
It is not a moral law or spiritual hierarchy, but the natural structure through which coherence expresses itself.

Every action, thought, and intention generates movement within the same field of truth that created it.  
Awareness does not escape this law — it _reveals_ it.

In fragmented systems, cause and effect are moralized: called karma, punishment, or reward.  
Within [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]], they are seen as neutral corrections — the balance of reality returning to itself.  
The universe does not judge what happens; it simply reflects coherence or distortion until balance is restored.

When we interfere with consequence — through denial, projection, or control — we disrupt that rhythm and name the result “unfairness.”  
When we allow consequence to teach rather than punish, awareness expands, and the system self-corrects.

---
## **Implications**

Recognizing cause and effect as the foundation of coherence dissolves blame, guilt, and victimhood.  

It reveals that awareness is not about control, but participation — the capacity to observe, respond, and realign within the natural flow of consequence.

Once this is understood, [[Terms/Morality\|Morality]] becomes unnecessary.  
Every effect already contains its own instruction; every consequence, its own correction.

## **Reflective Line**

> “Reality does not punish — it balances. Every cause only ever asks to be seen.”
