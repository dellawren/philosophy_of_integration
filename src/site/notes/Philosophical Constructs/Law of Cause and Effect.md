## Principle

Everything that exists participates in consequence. Nothing happens without cause, and no cause fails to create an effect — whether it is seen or unseen, immediate or delayed.

---

## Description

The Law of Cause and Effect is the baseline rhythm of reality. It is not a moral law, nor a spiritual hierarchy — it is the structure through which coherence expresses itself.  
Every action, thought, and intention produces an effect within the same field of truth that created it. Awareness does not escape this law; it illuminates it.

In fragmented systems, cause and effect are moralized — called karma, punishment, or reward. But in Integration, they are seen as the neutral movements of balance returning to itself. The universe does not judge what happens. It simply reflects it.

When we interfere with consequence — through denial, projection, or control — we distort the rhythm and call it unfairness. When we allow consequence to teach rather than punish, awareness expands and the system self-corrects.

## Implications

Recognizing cause and effect as the foundation of coherence dissolves blame and victimhood.  
It reveals that awareness is not about control but about participation: the ability to observe and respond within the natural flow of consequence.  
Once this is understood, morality becomes unnecessary — every effect already carries its own instruction.
