## The Phenomenon
Identity refers to the way an individual or group understands, defines, and locates itself within the world.

It may include personal traits, roles, histories, labels, affiliations, or narratives used to answer the question of “who I am.”

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Identity appears non-causal because it feels essential rather than situational.

From within human experience, identity:
- feels fixed rather than conditional
- feels threatened by change or challenge
- appears to precede action rather than result from it

This creates the impression that identity exists outside causal structure and must be defended independently of consequence.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, identity functions as **reference anchoring** within a causal chain.

Identity helps orient perception, expectation, and response by stabilizing how an actor locates themselves relative to conditions and effects. It does not generate causality. It frames how causality is interpreted.

Identity often forms downstream of repeated causal patterns and can solidify when those patterns remain unresolved.

---

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When identity is mislocated, several distortions arise:

- identity is treated as cause rather than reference  
- challenges to identity are experienced as threat  
- behavior is justified through identity rather than effect  
- resolution is resisted to preserve self-concept  

These distortions frequently reinforce [[Relational Loop]]s by prioritizing self-definition over causal completion.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Psychology, sociology, and cultural studies examine identity through self-concept, roles, and social categorization.

Within the framework, these observations correspond to:
- stabilization of interpretive frames
- repeated causal reinforcement
- defensive anchoring under uncertainty

Identity intersects structurally with [[Responsibility]] and [[Power]].

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not deny lived identity or personal meaning.  
It does not argue that identity is illusory or invalid.  
It does not propose erasure or uniformity.

Identity is treated here as **structural orientation**, not essence.

---

## Structural Summary
Identity anchors perception within a causal field.  
When identity is treated as cause rather than reference, resolution is resisted and loops persist.
