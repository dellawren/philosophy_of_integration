## The Phenomenon
Fairness refers to judgments about equity, balance, and comparative treatment between individuals or groups.

It is commonly invoked in contexts of distribution, justice, and perceived harm.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Fairness appears non-causal because it relies on comparison rather than direct causation.

From within human experience, fairness:
- focuses on relative outcomes rather than causal chains
- evokes moral response to disparity
- treats equivalence as corrective

This creates the impression that fairness should override causal process.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, fairness functions as **comparative evaluation across causal chains**.

Fairness does not arise from a single chain, but from the juxtaposition of multiple chains and their visible outcomes. It evaluates distribution, not causality itself.

Fairness often enters the chain as a secondary interpretive layer rather than a causal driver.

---

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When fairness is misapplied, several distortions occur:

- comparison replaces causal analysis  
- redistribution substitutes for resolution  
- blame is assigned without tracing origin  
- systemic intervention overrides direct consequence  

These distortions frequently activate [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Control\|Control]] and stabilize [[12-Terms/Relational Loop\|Relational Loop]]s at scale.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Law, economics, and social justice frameworks center fairness as a guiding principle.

Within the framework, these correspond to:
- attempts to manage unequal outcomes
- moral responses to visible disparity
- regulatory substitution for causal tracing

Fairness intersects structurally with [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Ethics\|Ethics]] and [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Power\|Power]].

---

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not deny inequity or harm.  
It does not argue against compassion or aid.  
It does not define fairness as error.

Fairness is treated here as **comparative perception**, not causal mechanism.

---

## Structural Summary
Fairness evaluates outcomes across chains.  
When fairness replaces causal analysis, resolution is displaced and control expands.
