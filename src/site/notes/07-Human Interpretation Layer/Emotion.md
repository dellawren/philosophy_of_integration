## The Phenomenon
Emotion refers to felt responses such as fear, anger, sadness, joy, or desire that arise in relation to internal or external conditions.

Emotions are commonly treated as guidance, truth, or motivation for action.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Emotion appears non-causal because it is immediate, compelling, and subjectively authoritative.

From within human experience, emotion:
- feels self-validating
- seems to demand response
- appears disconnected from structure or sequence

This creates the impression that emotion overrides cause and effect rather than registering it.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, emotion is **effect registration**.

Emotion reflects how conditions and changes are registered within the system. It does not initiate causality. It signals that causality has already occurred.

Emotion operates prior to interpretation but after effect.

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When emotion is misunderstood, several distortions emerge:

- emotion is treated as instruction rather than information  
- expression replaces resolution  
- emotion is moralized or suppressed  
- feeling is equated with truth or justification  

These distortions can sustain unresolved chains, particularly when emotion substitutes for consequence or responsibility.

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Psychology and neuroscience study emotion as affective and physiological response.

Within the framework, these observations correspond to:
- effect signaling within the system
- sensitivity to change and threat
- amplification under unresolved conditions

Emotion intersects structurally with [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Trauma\|Trauma]] and [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Self-Protection\|Self-Protection]].

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not deny emotional reality.  
It does not argue for suppression or expression.  
It does not frame emotion as weakness or error.

Emotion is information, not instruction.

---

## Structural Summary
Emotion registers effect within a causal chain.  
When emotion is treated as directive rather than informational, resolution is displaced.
