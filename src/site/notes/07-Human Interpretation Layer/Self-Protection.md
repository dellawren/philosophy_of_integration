## The Phenomenon
Self-protection refers to automatic responses oriented toward safety, survival, and threat avoidance.

These responses may include fight, flight, freeze, appeasement, withdrawal, or defensive behavior.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Self-protection appears non-causal because it operates **prior to conscious reasoning**.

From within human experience, self-protective responses:
- arise without deliberation
- override intention or values
- persist even when threat is no longer present

This creates the impression that self-protection exists outside choice, responsibility, or causal explanation.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, self-protection is **pre-ethical causal response**.

It activates when perceived threat interrupts normal chain processing. Self-protection does not negate [[Causality]]. It represents a rapid, protective redirection of causal flow.

Self-protection precedes ethics, morality, and narrative interpretation.

---

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When self-protection is misunderstood, several distortions emerge:

- protective responses are moralized or judged  
- survival behavior is treated as character or intent  
- regulation replaces resolution  
- threat responses become stabilized as identity  

These distortions often interact with [[Trauma]], reinforcing open chains and persistent loops.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Psychology, neuroscience, and trauma studies describe self-protection through stress responses and nervous system activation.

Within the framework, these observations correspond to:
- rapid causal redirection under threat
- prioritization of survival over coherence
- suspension of ethical or reflective processing

Self-protection intersects structurally with [[Trauma]] and [[Control]].

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not excuse harm.  
It does not deny responsibility.  
It does not frame self-protection as virtue or failure.

Self-protection is neither ethical nor unethical.  
It is **prior to ethics**.

## Structural Summary
Self-protection redirects causality under perceived threat.  
When treated as moral or pathological rather than structural, it becomes stabilized and prolonged.
