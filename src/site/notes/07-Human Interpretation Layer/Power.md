## The Phenomenon
Power refers to the capacity to affect conditions, outcomes, or other actors within a system.

It is commonly experienced as authority, influence, force, or leverage, and is often associated with hierarchy, resources, or control over consequences.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Power appears non-causal because it seems to override normal cause-and-effect relationships.

From within human experience, power looks like:
- the ability to act without consequence
- the capacity to impose outcomes independent of structure
- exemption from the effects others must absorb

This creates the impression that power operates outside causality rather than within it.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, power is **capacity within a causal chain**.

Power does not negate [[12-Terms/Causality\|Causality]]. It amplifies reach within it. The greater the capacity to affect conditions, the larger the causal footprint of action.

Power becomes structurally problematic only when consequence is displaced or mediated, rather than completed.

---

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When power is misunderstood or misused, several distortions arise:

- power is conflated with control  
- authority replaces responsibility  
- immunity from consequence is assumed  
- harm is justified through position rather than effect  

These distortions frequently generate [[12-Terms/Relational Loop\|Relational Loop]]s by interrupting causal completion between actors.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Political theory, sociology, and organizational studies examine power through hierarchy, governance, and resource distribution.

Within the framework, these observations correspond to:
- unequal causal reach
- asymmetrical consequence distribution
- mediation between action and effect

Power intersects structurally with [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Responsibility\|Responsibility]] and [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Control\|Control]].

---

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not define power as inherently corrupt or virtuous.  
It does not deny the reality of asymmetry or harm.  
It does not collapse power into morality.

Power is neutral. Distortion arises from how causality is mediated.

---

## Structural Summary
Power increases causal reach.  
When power displaces consequence, causality redirects and loops form.
