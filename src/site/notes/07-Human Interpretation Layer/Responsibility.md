## The Phenomenon
Responsibility refers to ownership of one’s role within a causal chain, particularly in relation to effect and consequence.

It is commonly associated with accountability, obligation, or fault.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Responsibility appears non-causal because it is often framed morally rather than structurally.

From within human experience, responsibility feels like:
- blame or accusation
- burden imposed by others
- punishment for wrongdoing

This obscures its actual relationship to causality.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, responsibility is **recognition and ownership of causal position**.

Responsibility arises when an actor acknowledges their role in producing conditions and effects. It does not precede [[12-Terms/Causality\|Causality]]. It follows recognition of it.

Responsibility enables causal completion. Without it, consequence is displaced.

---

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When responsibility is misunderstood, several distortions occur:

- responsibility collapses into blame  
- responsibility is externalized to systems or authority  
- punishment replaces ownership  
- avoidance is rewarded over resolution  

These distortions frequently reinforce [[12-Terms/Relational Loop\|Relational Loop]]s by preventing causal closure.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Law, ethics, and social systems formalize responsibility through rules, liability, and enforcement.

Within the framework, these correspond to:
- attempts to assign causal ownership externally
- mechanisms to force acknowledgment of effect
- substitutions for voluntary chain completion

Responsibility is structurally adjacent to [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Ethics\|Ethics]] and [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Power\|Power]].

---

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not equate responsibility with fault or guilt.  
It does not deny context, limitation, or constraint.  
It does not prescribe punishment.

Responsibility is structural ownership, not moral judgment.

---

## Structural Summary
Responsibility completes causal chains.  
When responsibility is displaced or moralized, causality redirects and loops form.
