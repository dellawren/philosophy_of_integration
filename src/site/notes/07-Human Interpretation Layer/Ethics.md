## The Phenomenon
Ethics refers to principles concerned with how actions ought to be taken, particularly in relation to harm, responsibility, and the treatment of others.

Unlike morality, ethics is often framed as reflective, situational, or philosophical rather than rule-based.

---

## Why This Appears Non-Causal
Ethics appears non-causal because it asks questions of *ought* rather than *is*.

From within human experience, ethical judgment seems to interrupt causality by:
- evaluating actions independently of outcome
- prioritizing intention over consequence
- appealing to abstract principles rather than observable effects

This creates the impression that ethical reasoning exists outside causal structure.

---

## Structural Location in the Chain
Within the framework, ethics functions as **attunement to causal coherence**.

Ethics arises when an actor recognizes their position within a chain and responds with awareness of how actions propagate effects. It does not replace [[12-Terms/Causality\|Causality]]. It reflects sensitivity to it.

Ethics emerges **after** causal recognition and **before** moral codification.

---

## Typical Distortions at This Layer
When ethics is mislocated, several distortions commonly arise:

- ethics collapses into moral rule-following  
- ethical concern is displaced into external authority  
- intention is treated as sufficient regardless of consequence  
- ethical language is used to avoid responsibility  

In these cases, ethics loses its structural grounding and becomes indistinguishable from morality or control.

---

## Correspondence With Existing Fields
Philosophy and applied ethics attempt to formalize ethical reasoning across contexts.

Within the framework, these efforts correspond to:
- attempts to describe coherent chain participation
- efforts to articulate responsibility without relying solely on rules
- recognition that consequence matters even when intention is emphasized

Ethics is structurally adjacent to [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Responsibility\|Responsibility]] but distinct from [[07-Human Interpretation Layer/Morality\|Morality]].

## Boundary Clarifications
This mapping does not define what is right or wrong.  
It does not prescribe ethical principles.  
It does not deny the role of values or conscience.

Ethics here describes *structural awareness*, not moral authority.

---

## Structural Summary
Ethics reflects awareness of causal coherence.  
When ethics is separated from consequence, it collapses into abstraction or control.
