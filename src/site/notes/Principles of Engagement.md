The Philosophy of Integration is grounded in the following orientations.  
These are not moral claims or prescriptions, but structural priorities that govern how the framework is articulated and applied.

### **1. Truth Over Comfort**

The framework prioritizes accuracy over reassurance.  
Comfort may stabilize experience temporarily; truth reorganizes it. Distortion often persists where comfort is protected at the expense of clarity.

### **2. Self-Authority Over External Permission**

Interpretive authority remains with the individual.  
The framework does not confer legitimacy, approval, or status. Decisions arise from local awareness rather than borrowed belief or social validation.

### **3. Cause and Effect Over Moral Accounting**

Experience is understood through consequence, not virtue.  
Outcomes reflect relational impact rather than moral worth. Guilt, obligation, and “should” are treated as interpretive overlays, not causal forces.

### **4. Freedom Over Performance**

Coherence does not require identity maintenance or behavioral display.  
When action is shaped by performance, distortion increases. Freedom emerges as alignment between perception, response, and conditions.

### **5. Clarity Over Coping**

Adaptive strategies that preserve incoherent conditions are not treated as resolution.  
Clarity exposes structural constraints and makes response possible without prolonging containment.

### **6. Responsibility Over Rescue**

Agency is neither transferred nor mitigated.  
The framework does not intervene, protect, or compensate. Responsibility marks the boundary of causal power and is inseparable from freedom.

### **7. Liberation Through Awareness**

Liberation is not defined as opposition or refusal, but as coherent response.  
Reactive rebellion reproduces distortion. Awareness-based action alters relational dynamics without creating new constraints.
