## Cultural Story
Culture treats boundaries as rigid rules, defensive strategies, or ways of controlling the behaviour of others. People are taught that boundaries must be earned, enforced, or justified. Boundaries become a mechanism for punishment or withdrawal — a social tactic rather than an internal truth. In this framework, boundaries are reactive: something you use *against* another person.

## Effect
The cultural story distorts the purpose of boundaries by tying them to morality, obligation, and emotional performance. This confusion creates conflict, guilt, and anxiety around setting them, leading people to over-explain, over-defend, or collapse into silence. Boundaries become inconsistent because they are driven by fear rather than clarity.

This distortion also reinforces control loops. When boundaries are framed as rules others must obey, they transform into covert attempts at managing someone else’s behaviour. Instead of creating coherence, they perpetuate fragmentation.

## Integrated View
In Integration, boundaries are not reactive. They are a *state of internal orientation*. A boundary is the quiet recognition of responsibility: what is mine to hold and what is not. It is not a request or command. It is simply truth.

From this perspective, boundaries require no enforcement. They are not threats, negotiations, or emotional performances. They arise naturally as clarity returns. A boundary is the point where you stop entering distortion out of habit, conditioning, or fear.
