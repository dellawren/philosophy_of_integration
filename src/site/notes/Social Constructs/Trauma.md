## Cultural Story
Culture treats trauma as both permanent wound and personal identity. The story says trauma defines who you are, how you behave, and what you can expect from life. It becomes a label, a category, and at times a moral credential. Society also demands disclosure — that legitimate trauma must be narrated to be believed.

This story creates a paradox: trauma becomes something to overcome while being simultaneously offered as an explanation for everything.

## Effect
The cultural framing freezes trauma into self-concept. It encourages looping: retelling, reframing, and reinterpreting the past in search of understanding. But the loop rarely completes, because trauma is treated as meaning rather than interruption.

This distorts relationships, boundaries, and self-perception. Trauma becomes a gravitational centre, pulling the self into identity structures shaped by pain, defensiveness, or hypervigilance. The wound becomes the narrator.

## Integrated View
Integration treats trauma as an unfinished internal event — not a self. It focuses on the system, not the story. Trauma dissolves when the awareness that collapsed is restored, allowing the loop to close.

This view removes shame, removes permanence, and removes the idea that trauma must be retold to be resolved. Trauma becomes a signal, not a definition. It becomes usable information rather than personal fate.
