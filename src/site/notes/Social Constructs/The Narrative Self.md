## Cultural Story
Society teaches that identity must be explained, justified, and narrated. The narrative becomes proof of who someone “is,” shaping belonging and morality. People learn to curate their story to gain validation, sympathy, or status. Identity becomes performance.

## Effect
This produces chronic self-reference — the looping and re-looping of personal history as the explanation for every present moment. The narrative self collapses possibility into continuity, limiting awareness to what aligns with the story. Creativity, truth, and responsibility all narrow because the story must stay intact.

## Integrated View
Integration reveals the narrative self as a stabilizing fiction: helpful when overwhelmed, but not foundational. The real self does not require narrative continuity. Awareness stands without story. When the narrative self loosens, clarity returns; when clarity returns, identity becomes fluid rather than defended.
