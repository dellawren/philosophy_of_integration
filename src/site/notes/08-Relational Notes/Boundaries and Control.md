## Overview
Boundaries and control appear similar on the surface — both involve deciding what is allowed and what is not. But within Integration, they sit on opposite ends of the internal spectrum. Control emerges from fragmentation; boundaries emerge from coherence. Control manages others. Boundaries orient the self.

## The Arc of Control
Control is the attempt to regulate external reality when internal reality feels unstable. It appears as coercion, pressure, manipulation, persuasion, or emotional force. Control is never about clarity — it is about securing safety through influence. It is a collapse into fear masquerading as authority.

In this arc, control is evidence that awareness has been overwhelmed. The system tries to stabilize by adjusting others rather than locating itself.

## The Turn Toward Boundaries
The movement toward boundaries begins when the self recognizes that control never resolves the internal condition driving it. Awareness returns, and with it comes the recognition that responsibility is personal. The system remembers what is actually within its domain.

From here, the person no longer negotiates reality through pressure or demand. They orient themselves through clarity. A boundary is formed — not to change others, but to remain coherent.

## Integration Point
Integrated boundaries are not reactive or defensive. They arise naturally from presence. When someone knows what they can hold and what they cannot, behaviour shifts without force. Boundaries remove negotiation from distortion and replace it with truth.

Control collapses the self outward; boundaries return the self inward.  
This transition marks the shift from fragmentation to sovereignty.
