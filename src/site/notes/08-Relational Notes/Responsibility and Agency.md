### **Overview**

Responsibility and agency are commonly treated as interchangeable. Within the Philosophy of Integration, they describe different relationships to cause and effect.

Agency refers to the capacity to act.  
Responsibility refers to where consequence belongs.

Confusing the two allows responsibility to be assigned where no agency exists, and agency to be exercised without accountability.

### **The Arc of Agency**

Agency is the ability to initiate action within a system.

It is constrained by:

- material conditions
    
- relational position
    
- access to power
    
- available information
    

Agency is situational, not absolute. It varies across contexts and cannot be assumed universally.

When agency is over-attributed, individuals are blamed for outcomes they did not cause. When agency is under-attributed, power hides behind abstraction.

### **The Turn Toward Responsibility**

Responsibility emerges where cause and effect intersect with agency.

It is not assigned.  
It localizes naturally.

Responsibility does not require intention, morality, or guilt. It arises from participation in a causal chain. Where agency exists, responsibility follows. Where it does not, responsibility does not belong.

Systems distort when responsibility is distributed symbolically rather than causally.

---

### **Integration Point**

Agency determines _who can act_.  
Responsibility determines _where consequence lands_.

Integration restores coherence by aligning responsibility with actual agency rather than narrative assignment. This removes both scapegoating and exemption.
