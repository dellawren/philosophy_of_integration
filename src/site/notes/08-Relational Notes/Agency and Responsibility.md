### Overview

Agency and responsibility are not interchangeable.  
They are mutually dependent positions within a causal system.

Agency defines **where action can originate**.  
Responsibility defines **where consequence must return**.

When these are misaligned, systems fragment.  
When they are aligned, learning becomes possible.

### The Arc of Responsibility

Responsibility, in fragmented systems, is often assigned without agency.

This occurs when:

- outcomes are demanded without authority to act
    
- expectations are imposed without capacity
    
- blame substitutes for causality
    
- responsibility is enforced externally
    

In this configuration, responsibility becomes burden.  
The individual is held accountable for outcomes they cannot meaningfully influence.

This produces compliance, resentment, or collapse, but not coherence.

---

### The Arc of Agency

Agency, when separated from responsibility, becomes distortion.

This occurs when:

- action is taken without ownership of consequence
    
- power is exercised while impact is displaced
    
- intervention overrides feedback
    
- choice is framed as freedom without cost
    

In this configuration, agency becomes entitlement.  
Action continues, but learning is avoided.

---

### The Turn Toward Alignment

Alignment occurs when agency and responsibility are correctly paired.

This requires:

- clarity about who can act
    
- clarity about who bears consequence
    
- refusal to absorb responsibility that does not belong
    
- refusal to act where consequence cannot return
    

Responsibility follows agency.  
It does not precede it.

---

### Integration Point

Integrated systems assign responsibility **only where agency exists** and allow consequence to return **only where action originated**.

When this alignment is present:

- action becomes precise
    
- intervention becomes unnecessary
    
- learning completes its cycle
    
- power does not require enforcement
    

The framework does not distribute responsibility equally.  
It distributes responsibility **accurately**.

---

### Relationship to Non-Interference

Non-interference preserves the agency–responsibility bond.

Intervening where agency is intact displaces responsibility and interrupts learning.  
Refusing to intervene where agency is absent clarifies where responsibility must be restored.

Non-interference is therefore not abdication.  
It is protection of causal integrity.
