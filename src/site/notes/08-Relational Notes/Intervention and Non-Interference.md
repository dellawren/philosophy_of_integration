#### Overview

Intervention and non-interference are not opposites.  
They are positions taken relative to power, responsibility, and awareness.

Intervention alters a causal chain.  
Non-interference allows a causal chain to complete.

Neither is inherently correct.  
Accuracy depends on _who holds power_, _where responsibility lies_, and _what information is still forming_.

#### The Arc of Intervention

Intervention arises when:

- one has the capacity to affect outcome
    
- discomfort is visible
    
- consequences appear preventable
    

In fragmented systems, intervention is often justified by urgency, empathy, or fear of harm. When responsibility is unclear, intervention becomes habitual and reflexive.

Over time, this produces:

- dependency
    
- misattributed responsibility
    
- weakened agency
    
- distorted cause-and-effect learning
    

Intervention becomes a substitute for coherence.

#### The Turn Toward Non-Interference

Non-interference is not inaction.  
It is a deliberate refusal to override a process that must be experienced to be understood.

Non-interference emerges when:

- responsibility is correctly assigned
    
- power is acknowledged but restrained
    
- interference would prevent learning, clarity, or closure
    
- action would serve the intervener more than the system
    

This is not detachment.  
It is precision.

#### Integration Point

Integrated power includes the _capacity_ to intervene **and** the discernment not to.

Non-interference becomes the ethical boundary that prevents power from collapsing into control. It preserves:

- agency
    
- learning through consequence
    
- clarity over comfort
    
- responsibility where it belongs
    

The framework does not prescribe intervention or non-interference.  
It clarifies **when each becomes distortion**.
