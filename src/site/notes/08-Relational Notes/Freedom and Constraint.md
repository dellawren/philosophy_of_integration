### **Overview**

Freedom and constraint are typically framed as opposites. Within Integration, they are relational.

Constraint makes systems readable.  
Freedom exists within what is readable.

Chaos is not freedom. Control is not stability.

### **The Arc of Constraint**

Constraint defines limits within a system.

In an **[[Closed Rule System]]**, constraint is explicit and enforced.  
In an **[[Open Human System]]**, constraint is contextual and emergent.

Constraint is not punitive. It is informational. It reveals what is possible and what is not.

When constraint is denied, systems become incoherent.

### **The Turn Toward Freedom**

Freedom is not the absence of limits, but the capacity to move coherently within them.

Freedom increases when:

- causal limits are recognized
    
- false agency is released
    
- intervention is restrained
    

Attempts to manufacture freedom by removing constraint produce instability, not liberation.

---

### **Integration Point**

Constraint reveals structure.  
Freedom arises through alignment with that structure.

Integration restores freedom by restoring legibility, not by abolishing limits.
