### 1. Domain of Inquiry

The Philosophy of Integration is an ontological framework concerned with the structure of reality as it is encountered through human experience.

It does not posit metaphysical substances, transcendent realms, or moral absolutes. Its focus is relational: how phenomena arise, interact, and reorganize through cause and effect.

The framework treats **experience** as a site of observation, not as a privileged source of truth.

---

### 2. Primary Assumptions

The ontology of Integration rests on the following assumptions:

1. **Reality is relational.**  
    Nothing exists in isolation. All phenomena arise within networks of relationship.
    
2. **Causality is primary.**  
    Events unfold through cause and effect, independent of human interpretation, intention, or moral evaluation.
    
3. **Coherence and distortion are structural states.**  
    They describe alignment or misalignment within relational systems, not goodness, badness, virtue, or failure.
    
4. **Experience is responsive, not punitive.**  
    What is encountered reflects relational consequence, not reward or punishment.
    
5. **No external moral ledger governs outcomes.**  
    Outcomes emerge from interaction, not from adherence to rules, beliefs, or identities.

### 3. Ontological Primitives

The framework relies on a small set of foundational concepts that are treated as ontologically basic within the system.

These are not metaphors. They are structural designations.

- **Cause**  
    An originating condition, action, or state that participates in relational influence.
    
- **Effect**  
    The resultant condition arising from relational interaction.
    
- **Relationship**  
    The medium through which cause and effect operate. Relationship is not optional; it is constitutive.
    
- **Awareness**  
    The capacity for perception and response within relational systems. Awareness participates in causality but does not override it.
    
- **Coherence**  
    A state in which perception, response, and conditions are aligned.
    
- **Distortion**  
    A state in which perception or response obscures or resists relational conditions, altering subsequent effects.
    

All other terms within the framework are derived from or dependent on these primitives.

### 4. Relational Loop Structure

Reality is understood as operating through **relational loops** rather than linear chains alone.

A relational loop consists of:

- a cause
    
- an effect
    
- a response to that effect
    
- the subsequent conditions created by that response
    

These loops are ongoing, recursive, and self-regulating.

**Relational Loop Theory** formalizes this process and describes how coherence is disrupted and restored over time through interaction rather than enforcement.

---

### 5. Status of the Human Subject

Within this ontology, the human being is not treated as:

- sovereign over reality
    
- separate from causality
    
- exempt from consequence
    

Nor is the human reduced to passivity.

The human participates as:

- a locus of awareness
    
- a source of causal input
    
- a responder within relational systems
    

Agency exists, but it is local, conditional, and bounded by existing structures.

---

### 6. What This Ontology Does Not Claim

For clarity, the framework explicitly does **not** claim:

- that reality is inherently benevolent or malicious
    
- that coherence guarantees comfort or safety
    
- that awareness dissolves consequence
    
- that distortion is pathological or immoral
    
- that integration represents completion, enlightenment, or finality
    

The ontology describes **how systems operate**, not how they ought to operate.

---

### 7. Stability and Revision

The ontological commitments outlined here are considered **stable** within the framework.

Future development may:

- refine language
    
- extend applications
    
- clarify mechanisms
    

But revisions will not contradict these core assumptions without explicit redefinition.
