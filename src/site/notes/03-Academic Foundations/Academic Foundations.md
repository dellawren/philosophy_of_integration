This section contains the formal commitments underlying **The Philosophy of Integration**.

These documents define the ontological, epistemological, and methodological constraints of the framework. They are provided to clarify assumptions, limits, and positioning for readers engaging the work analytically or academically.

The material in this section does not introduce new concepts or applications. It establishes the structural ground on which all other parts of the framework rest.

## Purpose

The purpose of _Academic Foundations_ is to make explicit what is otherwise implicit throughout the framework.

These notes answer questions such as:

- What is assumed to exist?
    
- How are claims evaluated?
    
- What methodological constraints apply?
    
- Where does the framework begin and end?
    
- How does it relate to existing traditions?
    

This section exists to support clarity, critique, and responsible interpretation.

- [[Methodological Commitments]]  
    Constraints governing how the framework is articulated, interpreted, and applied.
    
- [[Scope and Limits]]  
    The domains the framework addresses and the boundaries it does not attempt to cross.

## How to Use This Section

This section is not required reading for engaging the framework.

It is intended for readers who wish to:

- understand the formal structure of the system
    
- evaluate its coherence and limits
    
- situate it within broader intellectual discourse
    
- reference or critique it accurately
    

Readers interested primarily in application, reflection, or exploration may move elsewhere in the framework.
