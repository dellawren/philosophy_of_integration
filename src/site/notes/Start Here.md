## **Start Here**

This site is a framework that has been building in my mind for a long time. It’s the culmination of lived experience, hours of questioning, watching, and learning from and about life.

This work is intentionally unfinished. I wanted to share my understanding of how things function underneath what I call the human rules — things like morality, religion, right and wrong, or good and bad. But I also wanted to make space for feedback, questions, comments, concerns, and other ideas.

This framework will continue to evolve. I will keep adding pieces, making connections, and deepening the understanding of the human experience. It will be messy. There will be missing links. There will be gaps in the knowledge I lay out here. Some thoughts may remain incomplete for a while.

I encourage you to explore, ask your own questions, challenge yourself, and be open to the idea that maybe the human rules we’ve been taught aren’t true.

I’m not looking for agreement. I’m not presenting a political policy. I’m offering this as a tool for others to do their own questioning. Take what resonates and leave what doesn’t. Feel free to wander on your own terms. There is a lot to read.

Love to all.

## **What You're Looking At**

This site is a working document. I’m an author writing a draft in the open. It might become a book one day, but for now, it’s notes — my brain sharing the ideas as I come to them.

The entire body of work is called _The [[References/Philosophy of Integration\|Philosophy of Integration]]_. If you’re spiritually inclined, you may have heard the term _[[Terms/Non-Duality\|non-duality]]_. Integration includes the truth non-duality points to, but brings it back into lived, human experience. [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] is the acceptance of all that is, without the need for separation from or judgment of it. It is the acceptance of [[Terms/Cause and Effect\|cause and effect]] — the recognition that we are the cause in our own lives, even when we experience the effect of someone else’s cause. Our job is not to [[Terms/Control\|control]] someone else’s cause, but to meet the effect with awareness.

You’ll find notes, short entries, terms, concepts, and connections between them. As you explore one idea, it will likely lead you to another, and then another. It is the best rabbit hole I have ever created.

Feel free to explore at your own risk.

## **How To Read This Site**

There is no “right place” to start.  
This is an ever expanding web of ideas.

You can treat this like a garden or a labyrinth: pick a note, follow a link, and see where you end up. Each idea connects to others. The path you take will shape the understanding you receive, and that’s intentional.

A few things to keep in mind as you explore:

- You don’t have to understand everything at once — or at all
    
- Some notes are complete; others are seeds or fragments
    
- This is a growing draft
    
- Follow curiosity, not order
    
- If something feels confusing, move to another note and circle back later
    

There is no test at the end of this.  
The value is in what you notice — in yourself — as you read.

> Let the ideas meet you where you are, not where you think you “should” be.

## A Final Note Before You Wander

There is no map for this. You’ll find your own way through it.

Follow the ideas that spark something in you, skip what doesn’t, and come back to anything that lingers in the back of your mind. This is an exploration, not a curriculum.

You may get lost. You may find clarity. You may change your mind more than once.  
Good — that means it’s working.

Enjoy the adventure.

Love to all.
