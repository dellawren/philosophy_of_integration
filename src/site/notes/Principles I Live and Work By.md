**1. Truth Over Comfort**  
Truth isn’t always gentle, but it’s always liberating. I won’t dilute reality to make it easier to swallow. Comfort keeps you compliant; truth sets you in motion.

**2. Self-Authority Over Permission**  
Your life is yours to choose. No borrowed beliefs, no waiting for approval, no performance for acceptance. You are the one who decides.

**3. Cause & Effect Over Morality**  
No guilt, no “should,” no moral scorekeeping. Life unfolds through impact, not virtue. See what happens, learn from it, and choose with awareness.

**4. Freedom Over Performance**  
Authenticity isn’t a performance — it’s alignment. Drop the roles, the masks, and the “good behaviour.” Freedom begins where performance ends.

**5. Clarity Over Coping**  
Coping helps you survive the cage; clarity shows you the door. I’m not here to help you tolerate what limits you — I’m here to help you see it for what it is.

**6. Responsibility Over Rescue**  
I won’t hold the ladder for you or drag you toward your own life. Power returns the moment you stop outsourcing your growth. Responsibility is where your freedom begins.

**7. Liberation with Intelligence**  
Rebellion for rebellion’s sake is just another cage. Liberation rooted in awareness — not reaction — is what creates a life that actually belongs to you.
