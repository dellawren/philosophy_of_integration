This framework is offered as a lens — not a doctrine, not a badge, not a new rule-system.  
Here’s how to ensure it remains the tool it’s meant to be:

- **Use it for insight, not identity.**  
    The goal is not to become “integrated” as a status. The goal is to live more coherently.
    
- **Test it in your experience, don’t just study it.**  
    Concepts become alive through application. If a section resonates, watch how you show up, what changes, what the consequence teaches you.
    
- **Retain your sovereignty.**  
    You are the primary authority over your life. I share this framework; you determine whether it fits. If it doesn’t — discard, adapt, or move on.
    
- **Beware of performance.**  
    If you find yourself pointing to the framework as proof of growth (“I use this philosophy so I’m more evolved”), you’re circling back into the old model of identity through method.
    
- **Accept natural consequence.**  
    I do not guarantee safety, comfort, or blessing. This is not a promise of avoidance of “bad stuff.” It is an invitation to live accountable, responsive, and aligned. The system is responsive — not protective.
    
- **Stay adaptive.**  
    This framework is a work in progress. If you spot assumptions, mis-applications, or you feel stuck in it — let that feedback in. Growth doesn’t mean bigger or more complex. Sometimes it means simpler, truer.
    

Use this framework. See what happens when you stop negotiating with truth. See what falls away, what stays, what realigns.  

And remember: no one outside you signs off on your coherence but you.
