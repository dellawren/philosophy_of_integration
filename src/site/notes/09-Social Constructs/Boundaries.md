### **Cultural Story**

Culture treats boundaries as rigid rules, defensive strategies, or techniques for managing others’ behaviour. They are framed as something that must be earned, enforced, or justified. In this story, boundaries become instruments of punishment or withdrawal — social tactics rather than internal orientation.

Boundaries are positioned as reactive measures: something deployed _against_ another person rather than arising from clarity within the self.

---

### **Effect**

This framing distorts the function of boundaries by tying them to morality, obligation, and emotional performance. The result is conflict, guilt, and instability around setting them. People over-explain, over-defend, or withdraw entirely, not because boundaries are unclear, but because their purpose has been misassigned.

When boundaries are understood as rules others must follow, they quietly convert into control mechanisms. Instead of producing coherence, they reinforce relational distortion and maintain fragmentation.

### **Integrated View**

Within Integration, boundaries are not reactive behaviours.  
They are a **state of internal orientation**.

A boundary is the recognition of responsibility: what belongs within one’s capacity to hold, and what does not. It is not a request, demand, or condition placed on another. It is the point at which participation ends.

From this position, boundaries do not require enforcement.  
They are not threats, negotiations, or emotional displays.  
They appear as clarity returns and distortion loses its grip.

A boundary marks the moment the system stops entering incoherence out of habit, conditioning, or fear.
