## Definition

A **Distorted Chain** is a cause-effect sequence that formed while one or more required components were unavailable.

Most commonly, awareness was unavailable at the time of formation.

Distortion is not error.  
It is **architecture built under constraint**.

---

## How Distortion Forms

When awareness cannot enter a chain:

- perception cannot complete
    
- effect cannot resolve
    
- choice cannot occur
    

The chain compensates.

Substitutions occur:

- interpretation replaces perception
    
- identity replaces position
    
- reaction replaces choice
    
- repetition replaces resolution
    

The chain remains functional, but altered.

---

## Structural Characteristics

A distorted chain exhibits one or more of the following properties:

- looping execution
    
- fixed interpretation
    
- time collapse
    
- identity fusion
    
- resistance to new input
    
- consequence without closure
    

These are not malfunctions.  
They are stabilization strategies.

---

## Distortion Is a State, Not a Trait

A distorted chain describes a **chain state**, not a person.

No identity, behavior, or emotion defines distortion.

Distortion exists only as long as the chain remains active without awareness.

---

## Why Distorted Chains Persist

Distorted chains persist because:

- they are internally coherent
    
- they minimize risk
    
- they require less capacity than resolution
    
- they stabilize the system under load
    

The chain does not “want” to change.  
It has no preference.

It continues because nothing has replaced it.

---

## Resolution Conditions

A distorted chain cannot be repaired or corrected.

It can only end in one of two ways:

1. **Closure**  
    The original chain completes when awareness becomes available at the point of distortion.
    
2. **Replacement**  
    A new chain forms under awareness and renders the old architecture obsolete.
    

Both outcomes occur through structural conditions, not effort.

---

## Relationship to Threat Prediction

Threat prediction determines whether a chain can form without distortion.

Distortion describes what exists **after** formation under constraint.

Threat prediction is upstream.  
Distortion is downstream.

---

## Structural Summary

- Distortion forms when awareness is unavailable
    
- It is compensatory, not defective
    
- It preserves function under constraint
    
- It persists until replaced or closed
    
- It describes chain architecture, not psychology
    

> **A distorted chain is not broken reality.  
> It is reality running with missing components.**

---

When no distortion is present, the chain executes without interruption.  
Cause produces effect, awareness may or may not arise, and the next cause follows directly from the current conditions. No special designation is required.
