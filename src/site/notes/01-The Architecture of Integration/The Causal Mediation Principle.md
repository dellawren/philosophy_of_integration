### **Definition**

The **Causal Mediation Principle** describes what occurs when an external system intercepts a causal sequence and substitutes its own response in place of natural consequence.

Instead of:

**Cause → Effect → Resolution**

the sequence becomes:

**Cause → System Interception → Secondary Consequence**

This intervention prevents the original causal chain from completing.

The system may successfully impose order, compliance, or control, but the originating chain remains **structurally unresolved**.

---

### **Primary and Mediated Causal Sequences**

A **primary causal sequence** resolves through direct consequence arising from the original cause.

A **mediated causal sequence** diverts consequence into a secondary chain that satisfies system logic rather than causal continuity.

Once mediation occurs:

- consequence no longer maps directly to cause
    
- resolution is displaced rather than completed
    
- causal feedback becomes symbolic or abstract
    
- repetition becomes structurally likely
    

The system must then manage not only the original cause, but the **effects of mediation itself**.

---

### **Open Chain Persistence**

An unresolved causal sequence does not terminate.

When direct consequence is blocked, the chain remains active and seeks resolution through alternate pathways.

This persistence may manifest as:

- repetition of initiating behavior
    
- escalation of intensity
    
- displacement into new contexts
    
- generation of secondary chains
    
- reliance on external regulation
    

This behavior does not indicate defiance or pathology.  
It reflects **causal continuity under interruption**.

---

### **Structural Effects of Mediation**

Causal mediation reliably produces:

- open chain states
    
- secondary regulatory architectures
    
- dependency on enforcement
    
- progressive escalation
    
- loss of causal literacy
    

Over time, mediated systems become structurally dependent on continued intervention, as closure would eliminate the need for authority.

---

### **Relation to Chain States**

- **Closed Chain State** requires uninterrupted consequence
    
- **Open Chain State** results from mediated interruption
    
- **Secondary Chains** arise to manage unresolved load
    
- **Replacement** is inhibited while mediation persists
    

Causal mediation does not fail due to poor execution.  
It fails because **interception and resolution are architecturally incompatible**.

---

### **Canonical Summary**

- Cause resolves through consequence, not authority
    
- Mediation substitutes control for resolution
    
- Substituted consequence leaves chains open
    
- Open chains repeat, escalate, or displace
    
- Systems mistake compliance for closure
    

> **A system that replaces consequence with control produces open chains by design.**
