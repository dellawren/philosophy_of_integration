**Architecture vs. Instance** — the distinction between a causal structure and a single execution of that structure.

Failure to distinguish these produces category error.

---

## Architecture

**Architecture** refers to the underlying causal structure:

- what links exist
    
- how sequences propagate
    
- what conditions sustain execution
    
- how load is distributed
    
- how resolution becomes possible
    

Architecture is persistent across time and context.

It governs **how events will unfold**, not which events occur.

---

## Instance

An **instance** is a single execution of a chain:

- one event
    
- one reaction
    
- one experience
    
- one iteration of the sequence
    

Instances are temporary.  
They do not alter architecture by themselves.

---

## Why the Distinction Matters

- Awareness observes instances.
    
- Architecture determines repetition.
    
- Resolution acts on architecture.
    
- Replacement alters architecture.
    
- Memory encodes architecture, not instances.
    

Changing an instance does not resolve a chain.  
Only architectural change does.

---

## Common Errors Prevented

This distinction prevents:

- mistaking insight for resolution
    
- mistaking behaviour change for replacement
    
- mistaking emotional completion for closure
    
- mistaking awareness for agency
    

Instances inform.  
Architecture governs.

---

## Structural Summary

- Architecture is the executable pattern.
    
- Instances are single runs of that pattern.
    
- Chains persist because architecture persists.
    
- Chains resolve only when architecture changes.
    

**Resolution applies to architecture, not to events.  
Repetition ceases only when the sustaining structure no longer exists.**
