  og:title: Cause — The First Movement in the Chain
  description: Cause is the initiating event that begins the chain — neutral, impersonal, and outside your control. A clean look at how every chain starts long before interpretation.

**Cause** — the initiating condition that sets a chain in motion.

Cause is neutral, impersonal, and non-symbolic.  
It arises from conditions, not intent.

A cause may be:

- an external event
    
- another system’s behaviour
    
- environmental conditions
    
- biological activation
    
- timing
    
- residue from an already-active chain
    

Cause is not authored by the individual experiencing it.  
It is the point where reality makes contact with a system.

Cause does not assign meaning.  
It does not imply responsibility.  
It does not define identity.

It is simply the first structural movement in a causal sequence.

Cause is often misread as fault.  
This error introduces distortion into the chain before awareness is possible.

Fault is an interpretation.  
Cause is context.

A cause reveals the conditions present at the moment the chain began — nothing more.

> **Cause initiates the chain without conferring meaning, value, or blame.**
