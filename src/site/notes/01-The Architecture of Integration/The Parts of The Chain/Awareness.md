**Awareness** is the point in the chain at which the system becomes capable of perceiving its own internal movement.

Awareness is not regulation, insight, intervention, or control.  
It is the structural condition in which a chain becomes **internally observable**.

Before awareness is available, cause produces effect and the sequence executes automatically.  
When awareness becomes available, the execution of the chain itself enters perception.

Awareness does not interrupt the chain.  
It does not alter momentum.  
It does not impose pause.

**It makes movement visible.**

---

### **What Awareness Perceives**

When awareness is present, the system can register internal activity as activity:

- sensation as sensation
    
- emotion as motion
    
- thought as process
    
- impulse as impulse
    
- pattern as pattern
    

No interpretation is required.  
No judgment is applied.  
No distance is created.

Awareness is not reflective analysis.  
It is **direct registration**.

> **Awareness is the chain perceiving itself in motion.**

---

### **Structural Properties**

- Awareness is conditional, not guaranteed
    
- Awareness cannot be commanded or induced
    
- Awareness may be absent in entire chains
    
- Awareness is not equivalent to attention or consciousness
    

Awareness emerges only when system capacity is sufficient to hold effect without immediate discharge.

When awareness is unavailable, chains execute as loops.  
When awareness becomes available, chains become differentiable.

Differentiation is the precondition for resolution, but awareness itself does not resolve.

---

### **What Awareness Does _Not_ Do**

Awareness does not:

- stop effect
    
- prevent repetition
    
- imply agency
    
- produce choice
    
- correct distortion
    

Awareness changes nothing directly.

It only changes **what becomes structurally possible next**.

---

### **Relationship to Other Components**

- Threat Prediction determines whether awareness can enter a chain
    
- Distortion describes chains formed without awareness
    
- Choice becomes possible only after awareness
    
- Resolution requires awareness but is not identical to it
    

Awareness is a **necessary condition**, not a sufficient one.
