## **Overview**

The Use Cases section exists to show how the Philosophy of Integration can be applied in practice.  
The framework itself is descriptive — it explains the mechanics of coherence and the architecture of cause and effect.  
Use Cases demonstrate how those principles translate into real life.

This section is not an instruction manual or a set of rules.  
It offers examples, applications, and optional tools that help people work with the framework in ways that feel intuitive and grounded.

## **Purpose of Use Cases**

Use Cases serve three main purposes:

### **1. To illustrate how Integration functions in real time.**

They show what the framework looks like when it’s actually _used_ — not just understood conceptually.

### **2. To offer accessible entry points.**

Not everyone begins with the abstract philosophy.  
Some people start with a practical need: clarity, choice, coherence, or relief from confusion.

Use Cases act as doorways.

### **3. To support both self-directed and tool-supported practice.**

Some use cases are internal.  
Some involve tools (like AI).  
Some may eventually involve symbolic systems (like tarot).  
Each use case remains optional and modular.

## **What Use Cases Are Not**

- They are not prescriptions.
    
- They do not define “correct” behaviour.
    
- They do not replace the foundational framework.
    
- They do not override personal agency.
    

Use Cases simply show what’s possible when the framework is applied cleanly.

## **Current Structure**

Right now, this section includes:

- **The Self-Coherence Engine** (core use case)
    
- **Why AI Strengthens Integration**
    
- **Using AI as a Coherence Partner**
    
- **Expanded Use Case: Tarot** (acknowledged, not yet developed)
    

Additional use cases may be added as the framework grows.

## **How to Use This Section**

Move through these notes as needed.  
Use them as reference points, examples, or mirrors for your own process.  
There is no sequence to follow, no lessons to complete, and no progression to achieve.

Each use case stands alone.  
And each one points back to the same centre:  
**coherence, choice, and awareness.**
