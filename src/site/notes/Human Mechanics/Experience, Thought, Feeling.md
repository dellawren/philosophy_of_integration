Human causal processing occurs through three distinct domains: **experience**, **thought**, and **feeling**.

Each domain registers and propagates causal information differently. None of the three operates independently, and none defines reality on its own.

Together, they form the primary human interface with [[Terms/Causality\|Causality]] and [[Terms/Chain Architecture\|Chain Architecture]].

## Experience

Experience is direct sensory contact with conditions.

It includes:
- sound
- sight
- physical sensation
- proximity
- timing
- environmental input

Experience registers what occurs without interpretation or meaning assignment.

It reflects conditions as they are encountered, not what they signify.

Experience provides the raw input upon which later processing depends.

[[Human Mechanics/Early Chain Formation\|Early Chain Formation]]  
[[Human Mechanics/Biological Mirrors of The Chain\|Biological Mirrors of the Chain]]

## Thought

Thought is symbolic processing layered onto experience.

It performs:
- pattern recognition
- prediction
- narrative formation
- continuity maintenance
- abstraction

Thought organizes experience into meaning structures. It does not originate causal conditions, but it shapes how conditions are anticipated and responded to.

Thought operates downstream of experience and upstream of action.

Under distortion, thought may organize around incomplete or unresolved sequences.

[[Terms/Invisible Distortion\|Invisible Distortion]]  
[[Terms/Identity\|Identity]]  
[[Terms/Survival Logic\|Survival Logic]]

---

## Feeling

Feeling is internal state registration.

It reflects:
- physiological activation
- regulation or dysregulation
- load within the system
- unresolved or resolved sequences

Feeling signals the internal impact of causal movement. It does not describe external reality, intention, or meaning.

Feeling operates downstream of both experience and thought and provides rapid feedback about internal coherence.

[[Human Mechanics/Trauma Inside the Chain\|Trauma Inside the Chain]]

## Interaction Between Domains

These domains interact continuously:

- experience provides raw input
- thought organizes and anticipates
- feeling reports internal state

Under stable conditions, these processes align without conflict.

Under sustained distortion or interruption, divergence appears between them. This divergence reflects structural conditions within the chain, not error or failure.

[[Terms/Distorted Chain\|Distorted Chain]]  
[[Terms/Temporal Architecture\|Temporal Architecture]]

## Structural Summary

Experience registers conditions.  
Thought organizes patterns.  
Feeling signals internal state.

Together, they form the basic mechanics through which humans process causal reality.
