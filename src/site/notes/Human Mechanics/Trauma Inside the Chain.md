**Trauma** is a structural distortion within a [[Terms/Chain Architecture\|Chain Architecture]].

It forms when an event enters the chain at a magnitude, speed, or intensity that exceeds the system’s current [[Terms/Capacity\|Capacity]] to process and resolve it.

The chain does not break.  
It distorts in order to continue.

---

## Structural Formation

When causal processing cannot complete, the chain redirects.

This redirection:
- preserves continuity
- prevents collapse
- carries unresolved load forward

The resulting structure is a **[[Terms/Distorted Chain\|Distorted Chain]]**, not an interruption of causality.

Trauma is architecture, not an external wound.

---

## Trauma and Time

Unresolved chains do not progress linearly.

When closure fails, the event remains active, producing:
- repetition
- looping activation
- persistent relevance

This is a function of [[Terms/Temporal Architecture\|Temporal Architecture]], not memory error.

See:  
[[Terms/Circular Time\|Circular Time]]  
[[Terms/Distorted Time\|Distorted Time]]

---

## Trauma and Biology

Because the chain runs through the body, trauma reorganizes biological regulation.

This includes:
- altered nervous system thresholds
- stabilized reflexive responses
- shifted hormonal baselines

These changes reflect [[The Architecture of Integration/Biological Architecture\|Biological Architecture]] mirroring a distorted chain, not dysfunction.

[[Human Mechanics/Biological Mirrors of The Chain\|Biological Mirrors of the Chain]]  
[[Terms/Fear as Effect\|Fear as Effect]]

---

## Trauma and Memory

Trauma is stored as **active architecture**, not completed narrative.

Traumatic memory retains:
- unresolved sequence
- physiological readiness
- sensory activation

Until the chain closes, memory remains functionally present regardless of chronological distance.

[[The Architecture of Integration/Memory as Architectural Persistence\|Memory as Architectural Persistence]]  
[[Terms/Looping Memory\|Looping Memory]]

---

## Trauma and Developmental Timing

The structural impact of trauma varies by when it enters the chain.

Earlier entry embeds more foundational patterning.  
Later entry embeds more contextual patterning.

Development proceeds around the distortion rather than stopping.

[[Human Mechanics/Early Chain Formation\|Early Chain Formation]]  
[[Terms/Invisible Distortion\|Invisible Distortion]]

---

## Trauma and Persistence

Traumatic distortions persist because they function.

They:
- maintain predictability
- reduce immediate threat
- stabilize response under load

Persistence reflects successful compensation, not resistance.

[[Terms/Survival Logic\|Survival Logic]]  
[[Human Interpretation Layer/Self-Protection\|Self-Protection]]

---

## Structural Summary

Trauma is a distortion formed when causal processing exceeds available capacity.

It preserves continuity by reorganizing the chain until closure or [[Terms/Replacement\|Terms/Replacement]] becomes possible.
