### Overview

Marriage, within the framework, is not a moral ideal, a relational achievement, or a promise about permanence. It is a **human-made coordination structure**.

Placed under Human Mechanics, marriage is treated the same way as any other constructed system humans use to organize life: housing, contracts, schedules, institutions, roles. Its function is logistical before it is emotional, and structural before it is symbolic.

This placement is deliberate.

When marriage is treated as a moral or romantic construct, it becomes burdened with expectations it cannot structurally support. When treated as mechanics, its actual behaviour becomes visible.

### What Marriage Is

Within this framework, marriage is:

- A **formal agreement** to coordinate lives
    
- A **legal and economic structure**
    
- A **socially recognized unit** for logistics such as housing, parenting, care, inheritance, and responsibility
    
- A **voluntary configuration**, entered into and maintained by choice
    

Marriage does not create love, safety, intimacy, or meaning. It may coexist with them. It may not.

The structure itself is neutral.

---

### What Marriage Is Not

Marriage is not:

- A needs-delivery system
    
- A guarantee of emotional safety or fulfillment
    
- A solution to loneliness, fear, or insecurity
    
- Proof of commitment, maturity, or success
    
- A moral obligation to endure misalignment
    

When marriage is asked to perform these functions, it becomes unstable. The strain often shows up as conflict, resentment, control, or quiet depletion.

This is not a failure of the people involved. It is a misuse of the structure.

---

### Needs and Structural Load

Within the framework, **needs are decoupled from relationships**.

Needs such as food, shelter, rest, autonomy, meaning, expression, and contribution are real. They are not reliably met _through_ another person.

When marriage becomes the primary vehicle for meeting needs, it becomes load-bearing in ways it cannot sustain. Attachment turns instrumental. Conflict turns existential. Continuity turns moralized.

Marriage functions cleanly only when it is not asked to carry survival.

### Choice Without Narrative

Common relational narratives frame marriage as:

- “Forever”
    
- “Work you must keep choosing”
    
- “Commitment proven through endurance”
    

Within Human Mechanics, these narratives are unnecessary.

Marriage here is not maintained by promise, identity, or virtue. It continues because it functions.

The operative orientation is not:

> _I keep choosing this relationship._

But:

> _This configuration is still coherent._

Choice is present, but it is not heroic. It is not reaffirmed daily. It is not an identity.

When coherence ends, revision or dissolution is informational, not moral.

---

### Conflict as Information

In incoherent models, marital conflict is treated as a threat to identity or meaning.

Within this framework, conflict is **structural feedback**.

It indicates:

- misaligned capacity
    
- changing conditions
    
- excessive load
    
- incompatible expectations
    

Conflict does not require resolution through narrative repair. It requires assessment.

What is actually being asked of this structure? Can it carry that load?

---

### Permanence and Time

Marriage makes no claims about permanence here.

Not because permanence is denied, but because it cannot be asserted ahead of time without fiction.

Time is allowed back into the system. Capacity is allowed to change.

Marriage may last a lifetime. It may not.

Duration is not the metric. Coherence is.

---

### What This Placement Removes

Placing marriage under Human Mechanics removes:

- moral pressure to stay
    
- shame around leaving
    
- the idea of relational failure
    
- the conflation of endurance with depth
    

What remains is clarity.

Marriage is something people **do**, not something they **are**.

---

### Summary

Within the framework, marriage is a shared structure chosen for coordination, not a vessel for salvation.

It functions when it is light enough to move. It collapses when it is asked to be a life raft.

No romance is lost here. Only illusion.
