Invisible distortions are causal distortions that remain undetected within a system due to their functional stability.

Distortion visibility is not determined by structural alignment.  
It is determined by **cost**.

Invisible distortions are a subset of [[Distorted Chain]] dynamics.

## Visibility Thresholds

Human systems do not register distortion based on coherence.  
They register distortion based on detectable disruption.

As long as a distorted pattern:
- produces predictable outcomes
- maintains regulation
- avoids immediate threat
- sustains environmental stability

it does not register as distorted.

It registers as normal operation within the [[Chain Architecture]].

---

## Functional Stability

Some distorted chains remain stable because they successfully regulate conditions.

These chains may:
- reduce conflict
- preserve attachment
- maintain role continuity
- ensure predictability
- distribute load in manageable ways

Functional stability masks structural misalignment.

The distortion is real, but its effects remain within tolerable limits for the system.

[[Survival Logic]]  
[[Self-Protection]]

## Cost Accumulation

All distorted chains carry cost.

When cost remains below the system’s tolerance threshold:
- the distortion remains invisible
- compensatory patterns absorb the load
- detection does not occur

When accumulated cost exceeds tolerance:
- compensatory capacity fails
- regulation destabilizes
- distortion becomes detectable

Visibility follows **threshold breach**, not insight.

[[Trauma Inside the Chain]]  
[[Capacity]]

## Role of Reinforcement

Distortions reinforced by external reward, social approval, or role dependency remain invisible longer.

Reinforcement delays detection by:
- distributing cost externally
- stabilizing feedback loops
- normalizing distortion within the environment

This does not reduce distortion.  
It delays visibility.

[[Identity]]  
[[Morality]]  
[[Control]]

## Identity Attachment (Structural)

When a distortion remains stable across time, it becomes structurally embedded.

This embedding may:
- anchor expectation
- stabilize response patterns
- shape predictive modeling

Identity formation may later attach to these patterns, but identity is not required for invisibility to occur.

[[Experience, Thought, Feeling]]  
[[Identity Architecture]]

## Structural Summary

Invisible distortions persist because their cost remains below detection thresholds.

Distortion becomes visible only when accumulated load exceeds the system’s capacity to compensate.
