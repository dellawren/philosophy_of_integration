The emergence of a new causal sequence after a distorted chain has resolved.

Replacing a chain is not an act of effort, correction, or intention.  
It is the **structural consequence of resolution**.

When a distorted chain completes, the system does not return to neutrality or absence. Causality reorganizes. New sequences form automatically under present conditions.

Replacement explains why some shifts become stable rather than cyclical. What changes is not behavior, but **the conditions that made the old chain necessary**.

Replacement occurs between [[12-Terms/Chain Resolution\|Chain Resolution]] and [[12-Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]].  
It cannot occur while a distorted chain remains active.

## Visibility Does Not Cause Replacement

Distortion often becomes visible before it resolves.

Emotion registers strain through [[Emotional Feedback\|Emotional Feedback]].  
Awareness identifies pattern through [[Structural Awareness\|Structural Awareness]].  
Interpretation loosens when experience is recognized as an effect of [[12-Terms/Distortion\|Distortion]] rather than truth.

Visibility clarifies the system.  
It does not alter the chain.

Recognition removes confusion, not causality.

---

## Apparent Divergence Is an Effect of Weakening

As a distorted chain loses predictive accuracy, alternative causal paths may come into view.

This is not the formation of multiple active chains.  
It is the **weakening of one chain and the availability of another**.

What appears as a [[12-Terms/Chain Split\|Chain Split]] is the moment coherence becomes structurally possible, but not yet established.

At this stage:

- threat prediction may still operate
    
- secondary chains may still carry load
    
- participation may still be compelled
    

Replacement has not yet occurred.

## Agency Emerges Only After Resolution

What is commonly described as “choice” is unavailable while a distorted chain governs behavior.

In the Stillhouse sense, agency becomes accessible **only after**:

- [[12-Terms/Threat Prediction\|Terms/Threat Prediction]] collapses
    
- secondary chains lose necessity
    
- participation in distortion no longer carries survival weight
    

Choice here is not moral, behavioral, or aspirational.  
It is **structural orientation** within coherence.

---

## Replacement as Natural Participation

Replacement does not occur through opposition to distortion.

When a coherent chain becomes viable, participation shifts on its own. Energy no longer feeds the distorted sequence because it is no longer required for stability.

The new chain anchors because coherence does not loop.  
It proceeds as direct cause → effect, without detour, reinforcement, or identity stabilization.

Distortion does not end through confrontation.  
It dissolves through redundancy.

## Biological Effects Follow Architectural Change

As causal architecture reorganizes, biological systems reflect the update.

Emotion settles.  
Reactivity diminishes.  
[[Identity Architecture\|Identity Architecture]] loosens without collapse.  
[[12-Terms/Circular Time\|Circular Time]] gives way to [[12-Terms/Temporal Architecture\|Temporal Architecture]].  
Capacity for [[12-Terms/Choice\|Terms/Choice]] expands.

These shifts are **effects**, not mechanisms.

Replacement is not psychological change.  
It is architectural change mirrored by biology.

> _You don’t replace a chain.  
> You remain present when the old one is no longer needed._
