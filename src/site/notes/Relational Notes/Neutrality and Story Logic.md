## Overview
Neutrality and story logic represent two opposite interpretations of experience. Story logic creates meaning to stabilize emotion; neutrality removes meaning to stabilize awareness. One generates narrative coherence. The other generates structural clarity. Together, they reveal why people misread truth when emotion becomes the narrator.

## The Arc of Story Logic
Story logic arises when the system feels unsafe with uncertainty. It assigns motives, labels, and explanations — a way of converting raw experience into something emotionally manageable. Because story logic draws from memory, identity, and fear, it feels true even when it distorts the actual event.

In this state, awareness collapses into interpretation. The story becomes more visible than the structure.

## The Turn Toward Neutrality
Neutrality begins when the self recognizes the instability of its own interpretations. Instead of treating narrative as truth, the person becomes curious about what exists without the story attached. In this turning, the emotional perspective softens and the architectural perspective strengthens.

Neutrality does not invalidate emotion; it stops giving emotion authorship.

## Integration Point
Neutrality restores access to cause and effect by removing narrative interference. The self becomes capable of seeing what is present rather than what it means. This shift breaks loops because there is no longer a story to defend, justify, or negotiate.

In neutrality, awareness expands. From that expansion, choice becomes clean and responsibility becomes coherent.
