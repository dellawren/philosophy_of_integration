## Overview

Trauma and coherence appear opposite, but they are deeply intertwined. Trauma marks the exact moment coherence became unavailable. Coherence is not the absence of trauma — it is what emerges when the chain is no longer distorted by it. These two movements define the arc between survival and awareness.

Trauma collapses coherence; coherence dissolves trauma.  
Understanding both reveals how the chain reorganizes itself.

## The Arc of Trauma

Trauma enters when an experience overwhelms the system faster than awareness can respond.  
It bends the chain and creates:

- distorted time  
- protective emotion  
- identity attachment  
- looping memory  
- biological contraction  
- survival logic  
- reactive interpretation  

Trauma becomes the architecture that keeps the person safe, even when the danger has passed.

## The Turn Toward Coherence

Coherence emerges when awareness becomes available.  
It begins with:

- noticing the distortion  
- separating emotion from identity  
- allowing the backlog to move  
- replacing interpretation  
- returning the memory to neutrality  
- closing the chain  

Coherence doesn’t fight trauma — it expands beyond it.

## Integration Point

Integration happens when trauma is no longer the architecture, but the information.  
The chain reorganizes.  
Identity lets go.  
Memory becomes neutral.  
Emotion completes.  
Time moves again.

Trauma stops defining the self.  
Coherence returns the person to themselves.

> Trauma shows where coherence broke.  
> Integration shows how it returns.
