### **Orientation**

Psychology is the study of patterned human behaviour, emotion, cognition, and internal experience.  
It excels at describing _what_ happens inside the human system under stress, attachment, conflict, or overwhelm. Where it falters is not observation, but attribution.

Psychology frequently treats **effects of interrupted causality** as properties of the individual.

Integration reframes these effects structurally.

---

### **What Psychology Gets Right**

Psychology accurately observes that:

- behaviour repeats when conditions remain unresolved
    
- emotional states persist when experiences cannot complete
    
- symptoms cluster around specific relational and developmental contexts
    
- “maladaptive” patterns are internally coherent
    
- regulation matters more than insight
    
- environment shapes internal experience
    

These observations are correct.

What Integration changes is **the explanation**.

---

### **Where Psychology Distorts**

Most psychological models assume one of the following:

- the individual is the primary site of dysfunction
    
- internal states are causes rather than effects
    
- behaviour must be corrected, regulated, or managed
    
- pathology resides _in_ the person
    
- intervention is required to restore function
    

This produces diagnostic frameworks that **name outcomes while misplacing origin**.

Symptoms become identities.  
Coping becomes character.  
Survival architecture becomes disorder.

---

### **CMP: The Structural Clarifier**

The **[[01-The Architecture of Integration/The Causal Mediation Principle\|The Causal Mediation Principle]] (CMP)** reframes psychological phenomena:

> When a causal chain is interrupted or mediated, its effects do not disappear — they are displaced.

In psychological terms:

- emotional dysregulation reflects unresolved causal interruption
    
- behavioural repetition reflects incomplete consequence
    
- dissociation reflects interrupted continuity of awareness
    
- hypervigilance reflects persistent threat prediction
    
- people-pleasing reflects redistributed relational consequence
    
- shutdown reflects load containment, not refusal
    

These are not traits.  
They are **secondary effects of mediated cause and effect**.

Psychology names the effect.  
CMP explains why it persists.

---

### **Pathology Reframed**

Within Integration, pathology is not a condition of the self.

It is the **stabilized expression of unresolved causal chains**.

What psychology labels as:

- disorders
    
- dysfunctions
    
- maladaptive strategies
    
- personality traits
    

Integration reads as:

- structural adaptations
    
- load-sharing mechanisms
    
- survival architectures
    
- consequence displacement
    

This reframing does not deny suffering.  
It removes blame, permanence, and identity fusion.

---

### **The Role of Intervention**

Psychological systems often attempt to:

- regulate symptoms
    
- interrupt behaviour
    
- reframe cognition
    
- enforce coping strategies
    

From an Integration lens, these interventions frequently act as **secondary mediators**, preventing the original chain from completing.

CMP explains why:

- improvement may be temporary
    
- insight does not dissolve patterns
    
- regulation collapses under stress
    
- “relapse” is common
    
- progress feels effortful
    

The system is being managed, not resolved.

---

### **What Integration Adds**

Integration does not replace psychology.

It **repositions it**.

- Psychology describes internal effects
    
- Integration explains causal architecture
    
- CMP reveals mediation points
    
- Cause and Effect restores resolution
    
- Awareness replaces regulation
    

Where psychology treats patterns as conditions to manage, Integration treats them as **sequences to complete**.

---

### **Boundary Clarification**

Integration is **not**:

- a therapeutic modality
    
- a diagnostic system
    
- a treatment approach
    
- a replacement for clinical care
    

It is an **architectural framework** that explains why psychological models describe effects accurately while struggling to resolve them.

---

### **Structural Summary**

- Psychology maps _experience_
    
- CMP explains _persistence_
    
- Pathology becomes architecture
    
- Symptoms become signals
    
- Resolution replaces regulation
    

> Psychology tells us _what hurts_.  
> Integration explains _why it keeps happening_.
