Modern psychology treats pathology as a property of individuals. Symptoms are named, categorized, and located inside people, often as disorders, dysfunctions, or deficits. Trauma is framed as damage, and behaviour is interpreted as evidence of internal failure or maladaptation.

From the perspective of **Causal Mediation**, this framing is structurally incomplete.

Pathology does not originate in the person.  
It emerges when **causal chains are interrupted, displaced, or externally managed** rather than allowed to complete.

## Trauma as Interrupted Causality

Within Integration, trauma is not an event and not a diagnosis.  
It is the point at which **cause and effect could not complete** under the conditions present.

When a system cannot process consequence directly, mediation enters:

- authority replaces consequence
    
- punishment replaces feedback
    
- interpretation replaces completion
    
- control replaces resolution
    

The chain remains open.

What psychology later labels as pathology is often the **persistent effect of an unclosed chain**, not a defect in the individual.

## Symptoms as Architectural Signals

Behaviours typically labeled as pathological—hypervigilance, dissociation, compulsions, emotional numbing, reactivity, withdrawal—are not malfunctions.

They are **regulatory responses** generated by systems attempting to remain stable while carrying unresolved causal load.

From a causal mediation lens:

- symptoms are **signals of unresolved architecture**
    
- repetition indicates **blocked closure**
    
- escalation reflects **increased mediation**
    
- resistance marks **structural necessity**, not defiance
    

Pathology appears when regulation becomes permanent.

## Diagnosis as Secondary Chain

Diagnostic systems function as **secondary chains**.  
They stabilize environments, manage risk, and reduce uncertainty—but they do not resolve originating causes.

Diagnosis:

- externalizes responsibility
    
- redirects consequence away from relational chains
    
- substitutes categorization for closure
    
- often prolongs loops it aims to manage
    

This does not make diagnosis malicious.  
It makes it **regulatory**, not corrective.

## Causal Mediation Principle (CMP)

The **Causal Mediation Principle** clarifies this distinction:

> When natural cause-and-effect sequences are intercepted, displaced, or externally administered, unresolved effects persist and redistribute elsewhere in the system.

Pathology is one such redistribution.

What presents as “mental illness” is frequently **relational causality carried by an individual** because the system could not hold it.

## Implications for Treatment and Care

From an Integration standpoint:

- Pathology is **not personal failure**
    
- Trauma is **not damage**
    
- Symptoms are **not the problem**
    
- Compliance is **not healing**
    

Resolution occurs only when:

- mediation decreases
    
- consequence returns to its proper chain
    
- awareness replaces administration
    
- systems stop intercepting completion
    

Care becomes possible when we stop asking _“What’s wrong with this person?”_  
and start asking _“What chain never got to finish?”_

---

## Position of Integration

Integration does not replace psychology.  
It explains **why psychology keeps finding the same patterns under different names**.

It offers a structural model where:

- pathology is **architecture**
    
- trauma is **incomplete causality**
    
- healing is **closure, not correction**
    
- coherence emerges **without moralization**
    

This reframing dissolves stigma without denying reality.
