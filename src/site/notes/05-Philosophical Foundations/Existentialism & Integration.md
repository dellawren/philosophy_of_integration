### **Existentialism**

Existentialism centers on the claim that life has no inherent meaning and that humans are responsible for how they live within that absence. Meaning is not discovered but constructed through choice. Freedom and responsibility arise together: if nothing is predetermined, then each person participates in shaping their life through awareness and action.

Rather than following inherited roles, existentialism emphasizes authenticity — living in accordance with one’s own perception rather than external scripts.

Where existentialism becomes heavy is in its emphasis on authorship. When meaning must be created, existence can feel like a task that needs justification. Choice becomes evaluative. Authenticity risks collapsing into performance. Responsibility turns into pressure.

### **Integration’s Relation**

[[12-Terms/Integration\|Integration]] aligns with existentialism’s refusal of pre-given meaning, but diverges at the point of burden.

Meaning is not required.

Integration does not ask the individual to _create_ purpose in order to legitimize existence. It removes the demand entirely. Awareness replaces authorship. Coherence replaces justification. Life does not need to mean something in order to be lived truthfully.

Choice remains — but it is no longer tasked with defining the self.

> Meaning is optional. [[12-Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]] is sufficient.
