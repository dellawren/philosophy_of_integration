This section situates **The Philosophy of Integration** within the broader philosophical landscape.

These notes do not establish the framework’s formal structure or methodological constraints. Instead, they explore how Integration relates to existing philosophical traditions, questions, and lenses, clarifying points of alignment, divergence, and extension.

The purpose of this section is **context**, not authority. It provides philosophical bearings for readers who wish to understand where this work stands in relation to established modes of thought.

## Purpose

The notes collected here address questions such as:

- How does Integration differ from traditional philosophical systems?
    
- Where does it overlap with existing traditions?
    
- What problems does it inherit, revise, or resolve?
    
- Why does this framework refuse certain philosophical moves?
    

This section exists to prevent misclassification and to support informed dialogue, critique, and comparison.

## Included Essays

The following essays appear in the order they are presented on the site:

- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Where Integration Sits in the Landscape of Philosophy\|Where Integration Sits in the Landscape of Philosophy]]  
    A high-level orientation placing Integration among major philosophical traditions without synthesis or allegiance.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Ontology\|Ontology]]  
    A clarification of Integration’s ontological position: reality as relational, causal, and self-regulating rather than moral, ideal, or hierarchical.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Phenomenology - Why Experience Matters More Than Belief\|Phenomenology - Why Experience Matters More Than Belief]]  
    An examination of experience as primary data, distinct from belief, interpretation, or doctrine.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/The Constructivist Lens\|The Constructivist Lens]]  
    A discussion of meaning-making, perception, and the constructed nature of explanatory frameworks.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Existentialism & Integration\|Existentialism & Integration]]  
    A comparison between existential responsibility and Integration’s causal model of response.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Absurdism & The Release of Meaning\|Absurdism & The Release of Meaning]]  
    An analysis of meaning collapse and how Integration diverges from absurdist conclusions.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Non-Duality vs Integration\|Non-Duality vs Integration]]  
    A contrast between transcendence-oriented non-dual models and Integration’s insistence on consequence and participation.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Psychology and Integration\|Psychology and Integration]]
    An examination of psychological models through causal mediation, including how pathology, behaviour, and “coping” emerge from unresolved chains rather than defective individuals.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Pathology, Trauma, and Causal Mediation\|Pathology, Trauma, and Causal Mediation]]  
    A reframing of mental health and diagnosis using the Causal Mediation Principle, distinguishing structural survival responses from personal disorder.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Child Development\|Child Development]]
    An exploration of how early relational environments shape chain architecture, capacity, and survival logic without moralizing caregivers or children.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Sociology and Integration\|Sociology and Integration]]
    A look at how collective systems distribute consequence, normalize distortion, and externalize responsibility through structure rather than intent.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Politics and Integration\|Politics and Integration]]
    An analysis of governance, law, and power as large-scale causal mediation systems — and why control-based models inevitably reproduce instability.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Religion and Integration\|Religion and Integration]]
    A contextual reading of religious systems as early coherence technologies that preserved order, meaning, and belonging before causal understanding was available.
    
- [[05-Philosophical Foundations/Spirituality and Integration\|Spirituality and Integration]] 
    A reflection on spirituality as an experiential language for coherence — and why Integration retains the experience while releasing transcendence, bypass, and moral immunity.

## How to Use This Section

This section is optional.

Readers already familiar with philosophy may use these essays to situate Integration relative to traditions they know. Readers new to philosophy may skip this section entirely without losing access to the framework’s core mechanics.

These essays are exploratory rather than foundational. They describe _where_ the framework stands, not _how_ it operates.
