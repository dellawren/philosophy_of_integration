Ontology concerns the nature of reality itself — what exists, how it exists, and what kind of thing reality is prior to interpretation, belief, or meaning.

Where phenomenology asks _how experience is lived_, ontology asks _what kind of reality is being experienced_.

In the context of the **Philosophy of Integration**, ontology is not speculative or metaphysical in the abstract. It is structural. The framework assumes that reality operates through **cause and effect**, **relational consequence**, and **self-correcting coherence**, whether or not those processes are perceived accurately by human awareness.

Reality, in this view, is not moral, narrative, or preferential.  
It does not reward, punish, or explain itself.  
It functions.

Integration therefore rests on an **ontological claim**:  
that coherence is native to reality, and distortion arises from interference in perception rather than from flaws in existence itself.

This ontology does not posit a hierarchy of beings, meanings, or values.  
It describes a participatory field in which awareness, action, and consequence are continuously in relation.

Truth is not imposed onto reality.  
Truth is what reality is already doing when it is seen without replacement.

### Ontological Position of the Framework

- Reality is **relational**, not symbolic
    
- Consequence is **functional**, not moral
    
- Order is **self-regulating**, not enforced
    
- Coherence is **native**, not constructed
    
- Distortion is **architectural**, not evil
    

Ontology, here, is not something to believe.  
It is the background assumption that makes the framework internally consistent.

It names the _kind of world_ the Philosophy of Integration is describing — one where coherence is real, consequence is sufficient, and awareness participates rather than governs.

> Reality does not need to be corrected — it needs to be seen.
