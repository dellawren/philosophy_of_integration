# {{title}}

**{{title}}** — concise definition line in bold.  
Describe what it is *in your voice*, clean and declarative.

Add 1–2 short paragraphs that expand the definition:
- Explain its essence and purpose.
- Differentiate it from its systemic or conventional meaning.
- Anchor it within The Stillhouse or Integration philosophy.

You can include a reflective or evocative line:

> Example: “Awareness replaces obedience when belonging no longer demands betrayal.”

Then close with your references:
