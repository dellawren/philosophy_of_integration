This section situates **The Philosophy of Integration** within the broader philosophical landscape.

These notes do not establish the framework’s formal structure or methodological constraints. Instead, they explore how Integration relates to existing philosophical traditions, questions, and lenses, clarifying points of alignment, divergence, and extension.

The purpose of this section is **context**, not authority. It provides philosophical bearings for readers who wish to understand where this work stands in relation to established modes of thought.

## Purpose

The notes collected here address questions such as:

- How does Integration differ from traditional philosophical systems?
    
- Where does it overlap with existing traditions?
    
- What problems does it inherit, revise, or resolve?
    
- Why does this framework refuse certain philosophical moves?
    

This section exists to prevent misclassification and to support informed dialogue, critique, and comparison.

## How to Use This Section

This section is optional.

Readers already familiar with philosophy may use these essays to situate Integration relative to traditions they know. Readers new to philosophy may skip this section entirely without losing access to the framework’s core mechanics.

These essays are exploratory rather than foundational. They describe _where_ the framework stands, not _how_ it operates.
