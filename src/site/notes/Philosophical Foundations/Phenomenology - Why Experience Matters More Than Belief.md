Phenomenology begins with a simple premise: _the truth of something is found in lived experience, not in the ideas we hold about it._  
It focuses on how reality is experienced from the inside — through perception, embodiment, and consciousness — rather than through theories or beliefs imposed from the outside.

Two people can share the same event, yet the “truth” of that event differs because truth is shaped by how it was experienced. Phenomenology doesn’t ask _“What should this mean?”_ but _“How is this lived?”_ It brings philosophy back to the ground — to the felt, immediate, human reality beneath interpretation.

**Where Integration builds on this:**  
The [[References/Philosophy of Integration\|Philosophy of Integration]] begins with experience as the primary teacher — but moves a step further. It asks not only _what was lived?_ but _how is the experience being held, integrated, or distorted?_ Experience alone doesn’t free us; it is the awareness of ourselves within the experience that transforms it. Integration uses experience as the entry point into coherence.

> Experience is the doorway — awareness is the movement through it.
