Constructivism holds that humans do not perceive reality directly; they interpret it.  
Meaning is formed through cognitive and experiential filters rather than discovered as a fixed, objective truth.

Perception is shaped by memory, emotion, conditioning, culture, language, and personal history. As a result, two people can participate in the same event and register different realities, each internally coherent to the one experiencing it. Constructivism does not deny the existence of reality; it describes the limits of human access to it.

From this lens, truth is not a neutral transmission from world to mind, but a constructed relationship between experience and interpretation.

### Position Within the Philosophy of Integration

The **Philosophy of Integration** incorporates constructivism without collapsing into relativism.

Integration accepts that interpretation is unavoidable, but treats interpretation as **architectural**, not merely cognitive. Interpretive lenses shape causal chains, relational outcomes, and internal coherence. The question is therefore not whether interpretation exists, but what its structural effect is.

Within this framework:

- Interpretation can increase coherence or generate distortion
    
- Different interpretations are not equal in consequence, even if they feel equally valid
    
- Reality continues to operate through cause and effect regardless of interpretation
    

Constructivism explains _how_ meaning forms.  
Integration examines _what that meaning does_.

Interpretation is not error, nor authority.  
It is participation.

> Reality functions whether it is interpreted accurately or not.
