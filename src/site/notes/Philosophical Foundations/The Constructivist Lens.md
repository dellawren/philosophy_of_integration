We do not perceive reality directly — we interpret it.  
The constructivist lens suggests that humans create meaning from experience rather than discover objective truth as it is.

Perception is filtered through memory, emotion, conditioning, culture, and personal history. Two people can live the same moment and walk away with entirely different “truths,” each one coherent to the person who lived it. Constructivism doesn’t deny reality; it highlights the limits of how we access it.

**Where [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] builds on this:**  
The [[References/Philosophy of Integration\|Philosophy of Integration]] accepts that interpretation is unavoidable, but it does not stop there. Integration asks a further question: _What is the impact of the interpretation we choose?_ Instead of searching for the “right” story, Integration examines whether a perspective increases coherence or fragmentation within the self and between people.

Interpretation is not a problem to solve — it is a responsibility to hold.

> We may not choose the experience, but we are always choosing the lens we see it through.
