Existentialism centers on the idea that life has no inherent meaning, and that humans are responsible for creating purpose through choice. It brings freedom and burden in the same breath: if nothing is predetermined, then we are accountable for the lives we shape. Existentialism calls us to live authentically — to choose with awareness rather than follow inherited systems or roles.

Where existentialism can become heavy is in its weight of responsibility. When meaning is self-created, many feel the pressure to _get life right_, to choose a purpose “worthy enough,” or to justify their existence through achievement or identity. Authenticity becomes another performance to measure.

**Where Integration builds on this:**  
[[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] agrees that meaning is not given — but it removes the burden. In Integration, meaning isn’t a requirement for existence. You don’t need a purpose to justify being here. Instead of demanding that we _create_ meaning, Integration invites us to live with awareness inside the experience we’re already in. Choice becomes less about defining ourselves and more about staying coherent with who we are.

> Meaning is optional — [[Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]] is enough.
