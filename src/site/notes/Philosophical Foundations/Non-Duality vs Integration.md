Non-duality teaches that separation is an illusion — that there is no “self” and “other,” only a unified field of consciousness. At its height, non-duality dissolves identity, preference, attachment, and story. In pure awareness, nothing is personal, nothing is separate, and everything simply is.

But non-duality, when adopted prematurely or intellectually, can become a bypass — a way of escaping emotion, responsibility, or the human experience by calling it “illusion.” It can invalidate lived reality in the name of spiritual truth.

**Where Integration diverges:**  
[[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] does not remove the self — it includes it. Integration honours the human experience as part of the whole, not an illusion to transcend. It acknowledges oneness without dismissing individuality, sensation, or cause and effect. Integration is lived _within_ life, not above it. Instead of dissolving the self, it reconciles it.

> Oneness doesn’t erase the human — it restores it to its place within the whole.
