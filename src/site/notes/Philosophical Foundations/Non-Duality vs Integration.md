Non-duality asserts that separation is illusory — that the distinction between self and other dissolves at the level of pure awareness. In its classical expression, identity, preference, and narrative fall away, leaving undivided presence. Experience is no longer organized around subject and object, but apprehended as a single field.

Within this view, nothing is personal, nothing is separate, and nothing requires interpretation.

Difficulties arise not from non-duality itself, but from how it is applied. When treated as a conceptual position rather than an experiential realization, non-duality can be used to negate embodiment, emotion, or consequence. Human experience may be dismissed as “illusory,” and responsibility reframed as unnecessary. This produces abstraction rather than coherence.

### **Relation to Integration**

[[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] does not negate non-duality, but it does not prioritize transcendence of the human layer.

Where non-duality emphasizes the dissolution of distinction, Integration emphasizes reconciliation of levels. Individuality, sensation, and causality are not errors to be outgrown, but structures within the whole. Awareness does not erase form; it perceives it without distortion.

Rather than dissolving the self, Integration situates it — as a functional interface within a unified field, subject to cause and effect, capable of coherence.

Oneness is acknowledged without flattening experience.

> Unity does not remove form. It contextualizes it.
