**Non-duality** teaches that separation is an illusion — that there is no “self” and “other,” only a unified field of consciousness.  
At its height, non-duality dissolves identity, preference, attachment, and story.  
In pure awareness, nothing is personal, nothing is separate, and everything simply _is._

But when adopted prematurely or intellectually, non-duality can become a bypass — an escape from emotion, responsibility, or the human condition by declaring it “illusion.”  
This stance invalidates lived experience in the name of spiritual truth, mistaking detachment for awakening.

**Where Integration diverges:**  
[[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] does not remove the self — it includes it.  
Integration honours the human experience as part of the whole, not as an illusion to transcend.  
It acknowledges oneness without erasing individuality, sensation, or cause and effect.  
Integration is lived _within_ life, not above it.  
Instead of dissolving the self, it reconciles it — weaving humanity and divinity back into coherence.

> Oneness doesn’t erase the human — it restores it to its place within the whole.
