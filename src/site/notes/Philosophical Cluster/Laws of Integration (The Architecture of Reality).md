# Laws of Integration (The Architecture of Reality)

## Overview
This cluster gathers the universal principles that describe how Integration behaves within reality — not as moral commandments, but as observable laws of function.  
These laws reveal coherence through consequence, showing that truth self-regulates through the fabric of existence.

## The Continuum
1. **Law of Cause and Effect** — Reality mirrors what is; every action carries its reflection.  
2. **[[Philosophical Constructs/Law of Natural Coherence\|Law of Natural Coherence]]** — Nature does not contradict itself; morality is replaced by function.  
3. **Law of Integration** *(optional future addition)* — Opposites reconcile through awareness; fragmentation is only the illusion of separation.  

## Integration Thread
These laws form the ontological backbone of The Philosophy of Integration.  
They define how awareness participates in creation without claiming control, and how consequence restores equilibrium where interference once ruled.

> “Reality enforces truth not through punishment, but through pattern.”
