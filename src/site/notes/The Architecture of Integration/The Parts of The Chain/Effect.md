**Effect** — the automatic continuation of a cause through an existing architecture.

Effect is the immediate execution that occurs when a cause contacts a system.  
It unfolds without choice, intention, evaluation, or interpretation.

Effect precedes awareness.

It may manifest as:

- biological activation
    
- nervous system response
    
- sensory alteration
    
- emotional motion
    
- cognitive activation
    
- behavioral impulse
    

These are not reactions in the moral or psychological sense.  
They are executions of structure.

Effect is not communicative.  
It does not explain itself.  
It does not attempt correction.  
It does not imply fault, meaning, or responsibility.

Effect simply carries motion forward.

Because effect executes existing architecture, it reveals:

- current capacity
    
- conditioning
    
- threat prediction state
    
- stored load
    
- structural constraints
    

Effect is therefore **diagnostic**, not directive.

It is neither truthful nor distorted in itself.  
It is **informative** about how the system is currently built.

> **Effect is the system executing exactly what is already in place.**

## **Structural Notes**

- Effect is unavoidable once cause occurs.
    
- Effect cannot be interrupted retroactively.
    
- Effect does not require awareness to proceed.
    
- Effect does not imply the chain will resolve or loop.
    

Resolution, looping, or replacement occur only downstream.
