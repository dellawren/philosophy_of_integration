_The mechanics of architectural transformation._

Replacing the chain is the structural process at the heart of Integration.   
It explains how distorted patterns dissolve and why change becomes permanent rather than cyclical.  
It sits between [[Terms/Chain Split\|Chain Split]] and [[Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]] as the decisive turning point in the architecture.

---

## **1. Replacement begins when the distortion becomes visible.**

Emotion signals the bend — this is pure [[Terms/Emotional Feedback\|Emotional Feedback]].  
Awareness locates it through [[Terms/Structural Awareness\|Structural Awareness]].  
Interpretation separates from identity: you see that the meaning came from [[Terms/Distortion\|Distortion]], not truth.

This is the moment the old chain loses its invisibility.  
It becomes a visible architecture rather than a subconscious inheritance.

---

## **2. Two chains form — the old and the possible.**

The distorted chain continues to present its usual interpretation, shaped by [[Terms/Identity Architecture\|Identity Architecture]] and [[Terms/Survival Logic\|Survival Logic]].  
A coherent alternative emerges as a quiet but accurate truth.

This moment is the [[Terms/Chain Split\|Chain Split]] — the first structural divergence between old and new.

---

## **3. Choice becomes possible for the first time.**

Not moral choice.  
Not behavioral choice.  
**Structural choice.**

When two chains appear, you can decide which one to feed — not through effort, but through recognition.  
This is the beginning of **agency in the Stillhouse sense**, not the moral sense.

---

## **4. Replacement happens through participation, not effort.**

You choose the interpretation aligned with truth — this is the act of [[Terms/Replacement\|Replacement]] in motion.  
You act or remain still based on [[Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]], not on the loop’s demands.  
You stop reinforcing the meaning produced by the distortion.

The new chain anchors itself because coherence does not loop.  
It forms clean, direct cause → effect without the detour.

---

## **5. The old chain dies by starvation.**

No repetition.  
No reinforcement.  
No obedience to the loop.

Distortion loses its authority because awareness no longer feeds it.  
The [[Terms/Distortion Loop\|Distortion Loop]] dissolves not by confrontation, but by non-participation.

---

## **6. Biology rewires to reflect the new architecture.**

As the architecture changes, the body mirrors it — this is explained in [[Terms/Biological Architecture\|Biological Architecture]].  
Emotion settles.  
Reactivity dissolves.  
[[Terms/Identity Architecture\|Identity Architecture]] loosens.  
[[Terms/Circular Time\|Circular Time]] straightens into [[Terms/Temporal Architecture\|Temporal Architecture]].  
[[Terms/Choice\|Terms/Choice]] expands.

Replacement is not psychological change — it is **architectural change**.

> “You don’t fix the distortion. You walk into the moment that no longer requires it.”
