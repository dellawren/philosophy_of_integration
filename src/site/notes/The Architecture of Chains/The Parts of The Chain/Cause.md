**Cause** — the initiating event that sets the chain in motion — neutral, impersonal, and outside your control.

Cause comes from life itself: another person’s behaviour, the environment, timing, the body’s involuntary reactions, or the echoes of old chains. Cause is neutral. It is the opening motion of reality acting upon you.

Cause is not personal.  
It does not assign blame or meaning.  
It simply starts the sequence.

Most suffering comes from confusing cause with fault. Cause is not fault; it is context. It reveals the conditions you’re standing in, not your value or your identity.

> **Cause begins the chain without defining you.**

## **Tools**

**Tools** that support the Cause stage are all about **orientation**, not control.  
Cause is outside you — so the tools are about seeing clearly, not changing what happened.

- **Naming the Event**  
    A simple, neutral description of what occurred. No story, no blame, no interpretation.
    
- **Reality Check**  
    Asking: _“What actually happened?”_  
    Separates the event from the internal reaction.
    
- **Context Awareness**  
    Understanding that causes arise from conditions (timing, biology, other people’s chains).  
    Helps remove personalization.
    
- **Truth Statements**  
    Short grounding lines like:  
    _“This is what happened. It is not about who I am.”_
    

> **Tool Purpose:** Anchor yourself in what _is_, without collapsing into meaning-making.
