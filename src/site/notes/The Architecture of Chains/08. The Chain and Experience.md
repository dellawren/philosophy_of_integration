# **The Chain of Experience**

Experience is the first layer of the chain.  
It is the moment where something occurs **before** interpretation, meaning, or emotion takes shape.

This is the level of: 

- sensation
    
- event
    
- circumstance
    
- interaction
    
- stimulus
    
- the observable movement of life
    

Experience enters the chain like this:

**Cause → Effect → Awareness**

At this stage, the chain is pure.  
It has not yet been filtered through history, story, or identity.

Experience is **raw data** — the world touching your nervous system.

But because humans rarely meet experience without interpretation,  
most people never encounter experience directly.  
They encounter the _interpretation_ of experience.

Coherent chains allow you to feel the moment as it is.  
Distorted chains convert experience into something else before you consciously register it.

This is how distortion alters reality:

- you’re not experiencing what happened
    
- you’re experiencing what the chain _made_ of what happened
    

Experience is the input.  
The chain determines the output.
