### 1. Scope of the Framework

The Philosophy of Integration addresses questions related to:

- the structure of human experience
    
- relational causality and consequence
    
- coherence and distortion within individual and collective systems
    
- the role of awareness in response formation
    
- the dynamics of responsibility and agency
    

It is designed to explain **how experience reorganizes through cause and effect**, rather than why particular outcomes are desirable or undesirable.

The framework is applicable wherever:

- systems are relational
    
- causality is distributed rather than linear
    
- human interpretation influences response but not consequence
    

---

### 2. Domains of Applicability

The framework may be applied analytically to:

- individual decision-making
    
- relational dynamics
    
- ethical responsibility without moral prescription
    
- trauma understood as structural distortion
    
- symbolic systems (e.g., language, narrative, symbolic reasoning)
    
- artificial intelligence decision modeling
    
- social and cultural constructs
    

Application does not imply endorsement, optimization, or intervention.  
The framework functions as an explanatory lens, not a solution engine.

---

### 3. Explicit Limits

The Philosophy of Integration does **not** attempt to:

- predict specific outcomes
    
- prescribe behavioral norms
    
- resolve moral disagreement
    
- replace empirical science
    
- offer therapeutic treatment
    
- adjudicate political policy
    
- define meaning, purpose, or value
    

Questions that require normative judgment, empirical measurement, or institutional authority fall outside the framework’s scope.

---

### 4. Limits of Explanation

The framework does not claim comprehensive explanatory coverage.

It does not:

- account for all variables in complex systems
    
- eliminate ambiguity or uncertainty
    
- resolve contingency or randomness
    
- explain origin-of-universe metaphysics
    
- reduce experience to a single causal axis
    

Unexplained or indeterminate phenomena are treated as limits of current articulation, not as failures requiring narrative repair.

---

### 5. Limits of Application

Misapplication occurs when the framework is used to:

- justify harmful behavior
    
- override empirical evidence
    
- invalidate emotional experience
    
- avoid responsibility
    
- collapse complexity into certainty
    
- assert interpretive authority over others
    

Such uses fall outside the methodological commitments of the framework and do not reflect its claims.

---

### 6. Boundary Statement

The Philosophy of Integration is neither universal nor exhaustive.

It is offered as:

- a coherent explanatory model
    
- bounded by explicit assumptions
    
- subject to correction and rejection
    

Its value lies in what it can clarify — and equally in recognizing what it does not address.
