### 1. Scope of Knowing

The Philosophy of Integration is concerned with how understanding arises within lived reality, not with abstract certainty or metaphysical proof.

Knowledge within this framework is provisional, situated, and functional. It is evaluated by coherence, repeatability of pattern, and explanatory power, rather than by belief, authority, or consensus.

The framework does not claim access to absolute truth. It claims access to **structural intelligibility**.

---

### 2. Sources of Knowledge

The framework recognizes multiple sources of knowing, ordered by their reliability within the system:

1. **Observed Consequence**  
    Patterns that repeat across situations, contexts, and individuals.
    
2. **Relational Consistency**  
    The degree to which a model produces non-contradictory explanations across domains.
    
3. **Experiential Verification**  
    Direct engagement with cause and effect within lived conditions.
    
4. **Comparative Coherence**  
    Alignment or divergence from existing philosophical and systems models.
    

Personal intuition, belief, or revelation are not treated as authoritative unless they demonstrate consistency through consequence.

---

### 3. Criteria for Validity

A claim within the framework is considered valid when it satisfies the following conditions:

- **Non-contradiction**  
    The claim does not generate internal logical conflict.
    
- **Repeatability**  
    The claim describes patterns that recur across contexts.
    
- **Causal Plausibility**  
    The claim accounts for outcomes without invoking moral, supernatural, or unverifiable forces.
    
- **Explanatory Economy**  
    The claim explains observed phenomena without unnecessary complexity.
    

Validity is assessed through observation and reasoning, not endorsement.

---

### 4. Falsifiability and Revision

Claims within the framework are **falsifiable**.

A claim is subject to revision or rejection if:

- observed consequences consistently contradict it
    
- it fails to account for known patterns
    
- it introduces contradiction into the system
    

The framework evolves through correction, not defense. Disconfirmation is treated as informational, not adversarial.

---

### 5. Role of Experience

Experience functions as **evidence**, not as proof.

Individual experience is insufficient to establish a claim but is necessary for testing one. Experience is interpreted through pattern recognition rather than personal narrative or emotional intensity.

The framework explicitly distinguishes between:

- experiencing an effect
    
- explaining an effect
    

Explanation must remain accountable to observable structure.

---

### 6. Relationship to Empirical Science

The Philosophy of Integration does not compete with empirical science, nor does it attempt to replace scientific method.

It operates in a complementary domain:

- where controlled experimentation is limited
    
- where systems are complex, relational, and context-dependent
    
- where human participation cannot be removed without altering the phenomenon
    

Scientific findings may inform the framework, but no scientific theory is treated as ontologically decisive.

---

### 7. Authority and Interpretation

Interpretive authority within the framework is **distributed**, not centralized.

No individual, including the author, functions as a final arbiter of truth. Claims stand or fall based on their coherence with observed reality and their capacity to remain consistent under scrutiny.

Readers are expected to engage critically, test claims in lived contexts, and revise understanding accordingly.

---

### 8. Limits of Knowledge

The framework acknowledges inherent limits to knowing.

It does not claim to:

- predict outcomes with certainty
    
- resolve all ambiguity
    
- eliminate uncertainty
    
- provide total explanations
    

Uncertainty is treated as a structural condition, not as a flaw to be eliminated.

---

### 9. Epistemic Posture

The epistemic posture of the framework can be summarized as:

- observational rather than doctrinal
    
- corrective rather than affirming
    
- coherent rather than comprehensive
    
- provisional rather than final
    

Understanding is always subject to refinement through consequence.
