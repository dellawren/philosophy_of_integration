**Replacement** — the transition from a distorted causal chain to a coherent one through non-participation in the former.

Replacement does not modify, heal, or correct an existing chain. It occurs when awareness recognizes that a chain no longer reflects present conditions and ceases to supply it with interpretation, energy, or repetition. The original chain remains structurally intact but inactive.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, replacement is the primary mechanism by which distortion resolves. A coherent chain does not compete with a distorted one; it renders it obsolete. When awareness aligns with present cause and effect, the prior architecture falls out of use without resistance.

Replacement is therefore structural, not emotional. It reflects a change in participation rather than a change in content.
