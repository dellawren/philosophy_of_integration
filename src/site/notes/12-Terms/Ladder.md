**Ladder** — the ordered sequence through which awareness stabilizes into coherent participation.

In the Stillhouse framework, the Ladder refers to the **structural progression of awareness capacity**, not a hierarchy of value or attainment. Each rung marks a shift in how a system relates to fear, truth, consequence, and choice.

The Ladder does not describe improvement or ascent toward an ideal state. It describes **increasing tolerance for reality without distortion**. Early rungs are characterized by contraction and protective regulation; later rungs by stability, clarity, and internally sourced action.

Unlike repetitive architectures that maintain stability through looping, the Ladder represents **irreversible integration**: once awareness can hold a given condition without collapse, that capacity remains available, even if revisited under stress.

Movement along the Ladder is not linear or permanent. Awareness may operate from different rungs depending on capacity and context. The Ladder therefore functions as a **map of structural readiness**, not a measure of success.
