**Manipulation** is control disguised as care.  
It’s the subtle art of bending perception to maintain comfort, safety, or superiority.

It arises when truth feels too costly to reveal or receive.  
Every lie, guilt trip, or emotional hook is a symptom of fear’s desire to keep control intact.

Manipulation isn’t always malicious — it’s often survival logic dressed as love.  
But it fragments trust, replacing authenticity with strategy.  
Integration ends manipulation by restoring self-trust, removing the need to manage another’s reality.

> Manipulation thrives where honesty feels unsafe.
