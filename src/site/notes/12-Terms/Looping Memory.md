**Looping Memory** — the repetition of an unprocessed internal event that replays because the chain could not complete it. It is not voluntary recollection; it is the system attempting to finish what awareness could not hold.

Looping memory occurs when an experience overwhelms capacity and becomes suspended outside of time. Because the loop never closed, the memory remains active in the architecture — not as a story, but as unfinished consequence. It resurfaces through emotion, sensation, imagery, interpretation, or behavioural patterning.

This looping does not mean the system is stuck; it means it is still carrying the moment that exceeded awareness. Looping memory is the architecture’s effort to return the experience to sequence so that distorted time, protective emotion, and survival logic can dissolve.

In Integration, looping memory is not something to suppress or decode. It is the signal of an incomplete chain and the invitation for coherence to return.
