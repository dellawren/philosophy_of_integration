**Neutral Memory** — a memory that remains intact but no longer carries emotional distortion, survival logic, or identity. The event still exists, but the architecture that once kept the chain alive has dissolved.

Neutral memory is the point where the past stops informing the present through fear. It is not forgetting or rewriting; it is returning the memory to clarity without emotional charge. The interpretation has been replaced, the identity unhooked, and the emotional signature has completed its movement. The memory becomes information rather than a loop.

In Integration, neutral memory is the final indicator of a closed chain. A chain cannot end while memory still carries distortion. When the memory becomes neutral, the chain no longer determines behaviour, emotion, or identity — and replacement becomes possible.

> You don’t lose the past; you release the distortion that once defined it.
