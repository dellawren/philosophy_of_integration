**Fear** — the constriction of awareness in response to uncertainty.

Fear arises when perception encounters conditions it cannot reliably predict and interprets unpredictability as threat. It is not danger itself, but the internal signal produced when awareness narrows in an attempt to regain stability.

Within the framework, fear is treated as an **effect**, not a cause. It reflects the current state of the chain rather than the objective conditions of the situation. Fear indicates that awareness has shifted from direct perception into control-oriented processing.

Fear does not represent failure, weakness, or pathology. It marks the point where interpretation begins to override present-moment information. When the chain reorganizes and awareness becomes available again, fear diminishes without intervention.

Fear therefore functions as structural feedback: it shows where perception has collapsed into prediction rather than remaining in contact with what is occurring.
