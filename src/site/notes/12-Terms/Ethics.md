**Ethics** — the expression of internal coherence in action.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, ethics refers to the alignment between awareness, truth, and behaviour as it naturally manifests through cause and effect. Ethics is not a rule system, moral framework, or set of prescribed values. It is the _functional outcome_ of coherence.

Ethics arises when awareness accurately perceives consequence and action follows without distortion. It does not require enforcement, justification, or instruction. When coherence is present, ethical action occurs automatically because the system is no longer divided against itself.

Ethics is situational and self-regulating.  
It adapts to context without contradiction because it is grounded in awareness rather than obedience.

Ethics differs from morality in structure, not intention.  
Morality attempts to impose behaviour externally.  
Ethics reflects internal alignment.

Ethics does not prevent harm through control.  
It minimizes harm through clarity.
