**Consequence is the observable continuation of cause through time — the way movement makes itself legible in the world.**

It is not punishment or reward, but the relational unfolding of what has already begun. Consequence is how reality discloses alignment or distortion, not by moral judgment, but by feedback.

Every consequence carries information, not instruction. It reveals what happened, rather than telling us what to do.

When consequence is resisted, patterns repeat and loops remain open. When it is witnessed and understood, the system can reorganize toward coherence.

Nothing escapes consequence because nothing exists outside relationship.

> Consequence is how history remains visible in the present.
