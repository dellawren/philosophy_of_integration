**Causal Mediation Principle** — when an external system intercepts a cause–effect chain by inserting a secondary causal sequence, the original chain remains open.

Mediated consequences do not resolve original causes.  
They replace direct consequence with **symbolic, procedural, or displaced outcomes**, leaving the originating chain structurally incomplete.

Causal mediation explains why:

- punishment fails to change behavior
    
- systems escalate rather than resolve harm
    
- compliance replaces understanding
    
- repetition persists despite intervention
