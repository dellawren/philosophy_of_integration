**Systemic Interference** — the insertion of an external system into an active cause–effect chain in a way that alters, redirects, or replaces natural consequence.

Systemic interference occurs when a system positions itself as the primary responder to an event, overriding or displacing the original causal sequence.

The system does not stop the chain.  
It **re-routes** it.

Interference may take the form of:

- punishment
    
- reward
    
- policy enforcement
    
- moral judgment
    
- procedural consequence
    
- authority-based response
    

These actions may produce order or compliance, but they do not complete the originating chain.

---

### **Structural Effect**

When systemic interference occurs:

- the original cause remains unresolved
    
- consequence becomes symbolic rather than direct
    
- the chain enters an **open chain state**
    
- secondary chains form to manage unresolved load
    
- repetition or escalation becomes likely
    

Systemic interference replaces causal continuity with control continuity.

---

### **What Systemic Interference Is Not**

Systemic interference is not:

- guidance
    
- education
    
- empathy
    
- support
    
- awareness
    

Those may coexist with a chain, but they do not interrupt consequence.

Interference specifically refers to **structural substitution** — when a system inserts its own logic in place of the chain’s natural resolution.

### **Relation to Mediation**

Systemic interference is the mechanism.  
The **Causal Mediation Principle** describes its effect.

Interference produces mediation.  
Mediation produces open chains.

---

### **Canonical Summary**

- Systemic interference diverts consequence
    
- Diverted consequence cannot resolve cause
    
- Unresolved cause sustains open chains
    
- Open chains require ongoing regulation
    

> **Where consequence is replaced by authority, chains remain open.**
