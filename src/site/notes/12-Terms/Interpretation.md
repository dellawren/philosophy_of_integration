**Interpretation** — the meaning the mind assigns to an experience, shaped not by the moment itself but by the architecture of the chain running beneath it.

Interpretation is not neutral. It arises at the point in the chain where awareness encounters history. When the chain is coherent, interpretation tracks reality closely: it reflects truth, context, and proportion. When the chain is distorted, interpretation reflects the loop: fear, identity, protection, and inherited narratives. Most people mistake interpretation for insight, but it is simply the mind translating the chain’s architecture into language.

In Integration, interpretation is understood as a _structural byproduct._ It reveals the state of the chain far more than it reveals the state of the world. The work is not to argue with interpretation, nor to force a new one, but to replace the chain that generates it. When the architecture changes, interpretation reorganizes on its own.

> “Interpretation isn’t wisdom — it’s the story your architecture tells about the moment.”
