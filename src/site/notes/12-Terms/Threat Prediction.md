The system’s ongoing projection of danger based on prior conditions.

Threat Prediction describes the mechanism by which a system anticipates risk by extrapolating from past overwhelming conditions. It is not fear, belief, or interpretation. It is a **predictive function** operating within cause and effect.

Within the Integration framework, Threat Prediction explains why chains persist after their originating conditions have changed. When a system has learned that certain environments, signals, or relational dynamics correlate with danger, it continues to predict threat until sufficient contradictory input accumulates. This prediction maintains activation even in the absence of immediate harm.

Threat Prediction is not an error. It is a **coherent survival function** that remains active until it is no longer required. Resolution occurs not when prediction is challenged or overridden, but when reality consistently fails to confirm it.

> “The system does not remember the past; it predicts the future from it.”
