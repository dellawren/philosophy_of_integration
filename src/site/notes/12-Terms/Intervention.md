**Intervention** — the deliberate interruption or redirection of a causal chain prior to its natural resolution.

Intervention is not inherently corrective or harmful. Its impact depends on whether it restores causal clarity or replaces consequence with control. In closed rule systems, intervention tends to reinforce or modify rules. In open human systems, it often introduces distortion by delaying feedback or diffusing responsibility.

Intervention becomes destabilizing when it attempts to manage outcomes, prevent discomfort, or enforce preferred narratives rather than address underlying conditions. Coherent intervention clarifies agency and preserves feedback. Distortive intervention suppresses both.

Within Integration, intervention is evaluated structurally, not morally. The question is never “Was it kind?” but “Did cause and effect remain legible?”
