**Chain Architecture** — the structural anatomy of cause → effect → awareness → choice.

This term describes the underlying structure beneath all human experience. Every moment flows through this sequence, whether coherent or distorted. The architecture doesn’t change; only the interpretations inside it do.

Within the chain architecture is the foundation of Integration. Once you see the sequence clearly, you can change how you participate in it — not through force or effort, but through awareness and replacement.

> “The universe doesn’t speak in morality. It speaks in sequence.”
