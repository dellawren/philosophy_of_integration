**Experience** — the immediate occurrence of reality as registered by awareness.

Experience is what happens **before** interpretation, meaning, identity, or narrative are applied. It includes sensation, perception, emotion, and event as they arise in real time. Experience is not reflection on what happened; it is the contact itself.

Experience is neutral.  
It is neither true nor false, good nor bad.  
Those qualities enter only when experience is interpreted.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, experience is the **raw material** of the chain. Cause produces experience; awareness meets it; interpretation may follow. Distortion occurs when experience is replaced by story rather than registered as event.

Experience cannot be wrong.  
It can only be met or overwritten.
