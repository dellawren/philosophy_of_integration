**Shame** — the internal collapse of self that occurs when awareness is filtered through perceived rejection.

Shame is not a moral emotion and does not arise from wrongdoing. It forms when awareness turns inward under judgment and equates being seen with being unworthy. The self contracts, not to correct behaviour, but to reduce exposure.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, shame is understood as an energetic recoil rather than an ethical response. It reflects a misinterpretation of contact as threat and visibility as danger. The experience is architectural: awareness remains present but is distorted by condemnation, real or anticipated.

Shame persists as long as perception is mediated by judgment rather than reality. It dissolves when awareness meets the self directly, without interpretation.
