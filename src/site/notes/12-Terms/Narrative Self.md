**Narrative Self** — the version of identity constructed from memory, meaning, emotion, and story logic rather than direct awareness.

The narrative self is not the self. It is the story the mind tells about who you are, what has shaped you, and how your life must be interpreted. It stitches experiences into a coherent narrative to maintain psychological continuity, even when that continuity distorts what is actually true.

Within Integration, the narrative self is recognized as an artefact of story logic — a stabilizing mechanism the mind uses when it cannot rest in awareness alone. The narrative self feels solid because it organizes pain, belonging, identity, and expectation into something familiar. But it collapses the moment awareness no longer needs explanation to feel safe.

> The narrative self is what you become when the story speaks louder than you do.
