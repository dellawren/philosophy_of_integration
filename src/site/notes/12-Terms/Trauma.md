**Trauma** — a distortion created when an experience enters the chain faster or more intensely than awareness can process. It becomes part of the architecture, not an external event.

Trauma is not defined by the event itself but by what happens in the chain afterward. When awareness is unavailable, the chain bends around survival, creating a looping internal circuit that protects the person at the cost of coherence. Trauma reorganizes interpretation, emotion, identity, memory, and behaviour — and because the chain is non-local, its effects ripple into the chains of others.

This bend in the architecture becomes the ground from which cruelty, hypervigilance, defensiveness, story logic, and distorted power may emerge. These are not traits — they are the system attempting to stabilize itself in the absence of capacity.

In Integration, trauma is understood as architecture, not pathology. It is the structure a person had to build when coherence wasn’t possible. Trauma becomes the shape of the chain until awareness returns and closure becomes possible. It doesn’t make someone broken — it shows where the architecture couldn’t continue without distortion.

> Trauma is not the wound — it is the shape the chain had to take to survive it.
