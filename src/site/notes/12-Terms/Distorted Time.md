**Distorted Time** — the alteration of temporal experience that occurs when a causal chain cannot complete and awareness becomes unavailable.

Distorted time is not a memory error or psychological confusion. It is a **structural effect** of overwhelm. When an experience exceeds capacity, the chain cannot process sequentially. Temporal continuity bends, producing experiences of freezing, looping, stretching, or collapse. The moment remains active as if it has not yet passed.

This distortion sustains looping memory, persistent threat prediction, reactive interpretation, and trauma-based orientation. The system is not stuck in the past; the sequence is unfinished.

Within the framework, distorted time is architectural rather than emotional. It marks the temporal footprint of an incomplete chain and resolves when the sequence closes and continuity resumes.

> Time does not repeat. The chain remains open.
