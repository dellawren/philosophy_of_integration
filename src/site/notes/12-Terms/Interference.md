**Interference** is the attempt to control or redirect consequence instead of understanding it.  
It arises from fear of loss, discomfort, or change — the mind’s effort to manage what awareness has already revealed.

In Stillhouse philosophy, interference distorts coherence by interrupting the natural rhythm of [[12-Terms/Cause and Effect\|cause and effect]].  
It hides truth beneath justification and delays balance until awareness returns.

Interference is not failure; it is feedback.  
Its tension signals where control has replaced trust, and where understanding is ready to emerge.

> Interference is awareness paused by fear.
