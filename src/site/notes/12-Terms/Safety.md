**Safety** — the nervous system’s recognition that awareness can remain present without immediate threat.

Safety is not the absence of danger, risk, or uncertainty. It is the internal condition that allows perception to stay open without triggering survival override. Within the Philosophy of Integration, safety describes the threshold at which awareness becomes available rather than contracted.

Safety operates at both biological and experiential levels. When safety is present, the system can process cause and effect without collapsing into control, reactivity, or narrative substitution. When safety is absent, awareness narrows and perception reorganizes around threat prediction.

Safety is therefore a prerequisite for coherence, not a guarantee of comfort. It does not eliminate fear; it allows fear to be registered without governing interpretation or action. Control attempts to simulate safety through predictability and enforcement. Integration restores safety by stabilizing awareness within uncertainty.

Safety marks the point where the system no longer needs to defend against experience in order to remain intact.
