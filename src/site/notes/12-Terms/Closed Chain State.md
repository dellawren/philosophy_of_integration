**Closed Chain State** — a condition in which a cause–effect sequence has completed without interruption, diversion, or substitution.

In a closed chain, consequence directly follows cause until resolution naturally occurs. No residual load remains, and no secondary regulatory structures are required to contain unresolved effect.

A closed chain does not imply:

- justice
    
- morality
    
- fairness
    
- desirability
    

It implies **completion**.

**Key characteristics:**

- the originating cause has met its natural effect
    
- consequence has fully discharged
    
- no repetition is required
    
- no secondary chain is needed
    
- the system returns to baseline coherence
