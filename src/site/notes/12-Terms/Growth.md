**Growth** — a post-hoc human interpretation of structural change.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, growth refers to the **human narrative applied after a Structural Shift has already occurred**. It describes the perceived difference between a prior configuration of experience and a later one, without explaining the mechanism that produced the change.

Growth is not causal.  
It does not drive transformation, learning, healing, or resolution.  
It names an outcome _after_ the structural conditions sustaining a pattern have changed.

Growth commonly reflects one or more of the following observed changes:

- reduced recurrence of a prior loop
    
- increased access to awareness and choice
    
- simplified relational or causal structure
    
- decreased reliance on mediated interpretation
    
- expanded capacity to hold effect without collapse
    

These changes arise from altered structural conditions, not from growth itself.

When treated as a goal, growth functions as a **teleological overlay** that can stabilize distortion by justifying persistence (“this is happening so I can grow”). When held descriptively, growth can coexist with the framework as a **neutral label** for observed reconfiguration.

Growth does not imply improvement, virtue, maturity, or correctness.  
It implies only that the system is operating differently than it was before.
