**Phenomenology** — the philosophical study of experience as it is lived, prior to interpretation, explanation, or theory.

Phenomenology treats **direct experience** as the primary data of understanding. Rather than beginning with abstract models, beliefs, or external explanations, it examines how reality appears to consciousness in real time: perception, sensation, presence, and immediacy.

Within this approach, meaning is not imposed from outside experience. It arises from the structure of experience itself. What matters is not what something is supposed to mean, but **how it is encountered**.

In the Stillhouse framework, phenomenology establishes the **ground condition** for Integration. Experience is the point of contact; awareness is what reveals how that experience is being structured, filtered, or distorted. Integration does not replace phenomenology. It extends it by accounting for architecture, capacity, and causal sequence.

Phenomenology answers _what is happening as it is lived_.  
Integration answers _how that happening is being held_.
