**Relational Loop** — a persistent pattern of interaction created when causal consequence between two or more actors cannot complete.

A relational loop is not a psychological dynamic, emotional pattern, or behavioral issue. It is a **structural condition** that exists within the relationship itself.

---

Relational loops form when causal movement between actors is interrupted, mediated, or displaced. Action produces effect, but consequence is diverted away from the relational chain, leaving the interaction unresolved.

Because the chain remains open, interaction repeats under altered surface conditions.

---

Relational loops are maintained by regulation, correction, management, or external authority substituting for direct causal resolution. These substitutions do not remove causality. They redirect it, allowing the loop to persist.

---

Relational loops are stable, not accidental. They continue until causal consequence is allowed to complete between the involved actors.

---

> The loop does not persist because the actors are unaware.  
> It persists because the chain cannot close.
