**Cause and Effect** — the fundamental structural movement through which reality unfolds, where each event continues from prior conditions and produces consequence without judgment.

Within the framework, cause and effect is **non-moral, non-punitive, and non-corrective**.  
It does not reward, punish, forgive, or balance accounts.  
It simply continues.

Cause and effect describes **continuity**, not intention.

---

### **Framework Usage**

Cause and effect explains:

- how actions propagate through time
    
- why outcomes occur without moral meaning
    
- why control fails when it interrupts continuity
    
- why awareness changes consequence without abolishing it
    

Every thought, action, and condition participates in this movement.  
Effects are not reactions imposed on behaviour; they are **the next state of the system**.

---

### **Structural Clarifications**

- Cause and effect operates regardless of belief, awareness, or interpretation
    
- Consequence is not correction; it is continuation
    
- Awareness does not escape cause and effect; it **changes participation within it**
    
- Distortion arises when cause and effect is resisted or interrupted, not when it functions
    

Cause and effect is not something to manage.  
It is something to **see clearly**.

### **Relationship to Core Concepts**

- **[[12-Terms/Truth\|Truth]]** — perception that accurately tracks cause and effect
    
- **[[12-Terms/Coherence\|Coherence]]** — absence of contradiction between awareness and consequence
    
- **[[12-Terms/Integration\|Integration]]** — the return to alignment with cause and effect after interference
    
- **[[12-Terms/Responsibility\|Terms/Responsibility]]** — awareness of one’s participation in cause and effect
    
- **[[12-Terms/Control\|Terms/Control]]** — the attempt to override or redirect consequence

### **Structural Summary**

Cause and effect is the **base architecture** beneath all other constructs in the framework.  
It does not explain meaning.  
It explains movement.
