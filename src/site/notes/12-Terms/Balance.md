**Balance** — the dynamic expression of coherence in motion; the way a system naturally self-regulates through cause and effect without external control.

Balance is not symmetry, fairness, or stability held in place.  
It is **movement returning toward coherence** after interference.  
Where control attempts to impose order, balance restores alignment through participation and feedback.

In the Philosophy of Integration, balance describes **how correction occurs** when the chain is allowed to complete.  
It is not an intervention and not a moral function.  
It is the visible rhythm of cause and effect re-establishing relational alignment.

Balance does not eliminate difference or fluctuation.  
It operates _through_ contrast, tension, and adjustment.  
When interference stops, balance resumes automatically.

> Balance is not stillness — it is coherence adjusting itself.
