**Truth** — alignment between awareness and reality once interpretation quiets.  
It is not belief, consensus, or agreement. Truth is what remains when the mind stops asserting its meaning over what actually occurred.

Truth does not arise from objectivity or neutrality; it arises from contact.  
Where coherence is the clean meeting with **reality-as-event**, truth is the recognition that emerges from that meeting. It is the inner sense that nothing is being distorted — that awareness is touching the moment without rearranging it.

In this philosophy, truth is not the opposite of lies. It is the dissolution of distortion. It expands as awareness expands, because truth is relational: the more clearly we meet the event, the more clearly we see the patterns that run through it.

Truth does not take sides.  
It does not justify, defend, accuse, or explain.  
Truth is simply the alignment between what happened and what awareness allows itself to acknowledge.

> “Truth reveals itself when interpretation steps aside.”
