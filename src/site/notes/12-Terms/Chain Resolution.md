## **Chain Resolution** — the completion of a causal sequence once the conditions sustaining it are no longer present.

Chain Resolution describes the point at which a causal chain ceases to reproduce itself. Resolution is not an action taken by the system, nor an outcome achieved through effort, insight, or correction. It is an **effect** that occurs when the inputs maintaining a chain no longer apply.

Within the Integration framework, Chain Resolution is governed by non-interference. Chains resolve when their causal sequence is allowed to complete without interruption, substitution, or moral overlay. When interference is removed and contradictory inputs persist, the system updates naturally and the chain no longer needs to fire.

Chain Resolution is often quiet. Its presence is marked not by change effort, but by the absence of compulsion. Behavior, emotion, and orientation shift only after resolution has occurred, never as its cause.

> “A chain does not end because it is challenged, but because it is no longer required.”
