**Circular Time** — the experiential repetition of time produced by a looping causal architecture.

Circular time occurs when a causal chain cannot complete and instead re-enters itself. The resulting temporal experience feels repetitive, stalled, or recursive, marked by the return of similar emotional states, relational patterns, or situational outcomes. This is not symbolic, psychological, or mystical; it is a direct expression of the chain’s structure.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, time reflects architecture.  
When a chain is coherent, temporal experience progresses linearly.  
When a chain is distorted or unresolved, temporal experience curves inward and repeats.

Circular time persists as long as participation in the distorted chain continues. It dissolves immediately when the loop is exited, not through resolution or healing, but through **non-participation**. When the chain straightens, temporal experience reorganizes accordingly.

Circular time therefore indicates **structural repetition**, not fate, pattern-making, or destiny.
