**Chain collapse** occurs when a cause–effect chain loses structural viability and can no longer carry, return, or resolve consequence.

Collapse is not delay.  
It is not interruption.  
It is not pain, trauma, or intensity.

Collapse is **structural impossibility**.

Once a chain has collapsed, increased effort, time, or capacity will not restore it. The chain must be abandoned or replaced.

### Structural Criteria

A chain is collapsed when:

- cause no longer produces a coherent or meaningful effect
    
- consequence cannot return to the initiating point or system
    
- load cannot be completed, redistributed, or mediated
    
- the organizing function of the chain has failed
    

A collapsed chain is not dormant. It is non-viable.

### What Chain Collapse Is Not

Chain collapse is commonly misidentified at the human layer.

It is **not**:

- trauma
    
- grief
    
- overwhelm
    
- emotional shutdown
    
- loss of access
    
- identity disruption
    
- temporary incapacity
    

These are **load conditions**, not structural failure.

A chain can be traumatized and still intact.  
A chain can be paused and still viable.  
A chain can be distorted and still capable of resolution.

Collapse refers only to the **loss of causal continuity**.

### Trauma and Chain Collapse

Trauma does not imply collapse.

Trauma occurs when load exceeds processing capacity. Consequence is deferred, stored, or rerouted to preserve survival.

In trauma:

- chains are interrupted, not destroyed
    
- resolution is delayed, not impossible
    
- consequence persists, even if displaced
    

Most traumatized chains remain structurally intact and may resume or complete when capacity increases or mediation dissolves.

Mislabeling trauma as collapse leads to premature abandonment and narratives of brokenness.

### Death and Chain Collapse

Death is not inherently chain collapse.

Death is a **discontinuity of participation**. It removes an organism’s capacity to receive or complete future consequence, but it does not automatically terminate the chain itself.

Because chains are non-local, they may:

- persist beyond the originating node
    
- redistribute load to other participants
    
- resolve posthumously
    
- decay gradually rather than collapse
    

Chain collapse occurs only when a chain is fully localized to the deceased node and no structural replacement exists.

Even then, collapse is **local**, not total.

---

### Recognition

Structurally, chain collapse appears as:

- repeated action produces no return
    
- the original function cannot be restored
    
- substitution attempts fail or create unrelated chains
    
- persistence increases distortion rather than resolution
    

From the human layer, collapse is often described as loss or finality.  
Structurally, it indicates **non-viability**, not failure.

---

### Implication

Collapsed chains do not require healing, fixing, or explanation.

They require **abandonment**.

New chains are not repairs.  
They are replacements.

---

### Anchor Definition

**Chain collapse is not when something hurts or stops.  
It is when the structure itself can no longer carry consequence.**
