  description: "A Stillhouse definition of capacity as the system’s ability to hold experience without collapsing into distortion, survival logic, or reactive interpretation."

**Capacity** — the amount of experience a system can hold **without reorganizing into protective architecture**.

Within the framework, capacity refers to **available awareness**, not skill, resilience, emotional intelligence, or regulation.

When capacity is sufficient, experience passes through the chain without distortion.  
When experience exceeds capacity, the chain bends automatically to preserve continuity.

Capacity is **situational and fluctuating**, not personal or moral.

---

### **Framework Usage**

Capacity explains:

- why the same event produces different outcomes in different systems
    
- why trauma forms without intention
    
- why awareness can disappear and later return
    
- why distortion is structural, not chosen
    

Capacity does not describe _what should happen_.  
It describes **what the system can currently hold**.

---

### **Structural Notes**

- Capacity sets the threshold at which distortion enters the chain
    
- Trauma corresponds to experience exceeding capacity
    
- Awareness remains present only while capacity allows
    
- Integration becomes possible when capacity is sufficient for awareness to stay available
