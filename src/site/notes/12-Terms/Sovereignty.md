**Sovereignty** — the structural fact that only the actor within a causal sequence has direct access to its internal conditions, perception, and thresholds of awareness.

Within the framework, sovereignty is not autonomy, independence, or authority.  
It names a **positional limit**: no external observer can occupy another system’s internal loop without altering it.

Sovereignty establishes where interpretation must stop.

---

### **Framework Usage**

Sovereignty explains:

- why external correction distorts causal chains
    
- why responsibility cannot be transferred or imposed
    
- why interpretation from outside a loop introduces interference
    
- why awareness cannot be delegated
    

Only the participant inside an event can register its internal cause, nervous system state, perceptual field, and meaning-making process without distortion.

---

### **Structural Notes**

- Sovereignty is not chosen; it is inherent to position
    
- External understanding is always partial
    
- External authority always introduces modification
    
- Respecting sovereignty preserves causal integrity
    

Without sovereignty, systems default to control, moral intrusion, or interpretive dominance.
