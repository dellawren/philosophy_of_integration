**Agency** is the capacity to initiate action **from within one’s own responsibility domain** and to bear the consequences of that action without displacement.

Agency is not freedom, power, intention, or choice.  
It is **the point at which responsibility, capacity, and consequence meet**.

Agency exists only where:

- the action originates internally
    
- the effects return to the same system
    
- responsibility is not transferred or avoided

### Clarification

Agency does not require:

- confidence
    
- certainty
    
- success
    
- moral correctness
    

It requires **ownership**.

A person may have options without agency.  
A person may act without agency.  
A person may hold power without agency.

Agency is present only when action and consequence remain coherently linked.

### Fragmented Agency

Agency becomes fragmented when:

- consequences are externalized
    
- responsibility is shared ambiguously
    
- authority overrides learning
    
- outcomes are buffered by others
    
- intervention interrupts causal feedback
    

In fragmented systems, people appear active while remaining unagentic. Movement occurs, but learning does not.

This produces dependency, resentment, and repeated patterns.

### Integrated Agency

Integrated agency is quiet.

It is characterized by:

- acting without compulsion
    
- tolerating consequence as information
    
- not requiring rescue or validation
    
- not outsourcing discomfort
    
- not interfering with others’ learning
    

Integrated agency does not seek permission and does not demand protection from outcome.

---

### Relationship to Non-Interference

Non-interference preserves agency.

Intervening in a system where agency is intact collapses learning by absorbing consequence that does not belong to the intervener.

Non-interference is therefore not withdrawal.  
It is **respect for agency boundaries**.

---

### Relationship to Power and Responsibility

Power without agency becomes control.  
Responsibility without agency becomes burden.

Agency is the stabilizing factor that prevents both distortions.

---

### Reflective Note (optional)

Agency is not something granted or removed.  
It is something revealed when interference stops.
