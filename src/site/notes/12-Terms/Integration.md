**Integration** is the process of returning awareness to reality — the movement through which perception, emotion, and experience realign with what cause and effect is actually doing. It is the gradual dissolving of distortion so that awareness can meet life without resistance.

Integration does not seek perfection, healing, or transcendence, but **wholeness**: the capacity to hold opposites without forcing them into agreement.  
It allows pain and peace, logic and emotion, body and consciousness to coexist without hierarchy.

In this view, integration is not something the self _does_ — it is what reveals itself when judgment loosens and awareness stops trying to control the experience it’s in.  
The fragments of perception fall back into their natural order because nothing is being pushed away.

Integration is therefore not an act of fixing, but of **allowing**.  
As awareness settles into coherence, truth shifts from something we _think_ to something we _live_.

> Integration is not perfection — it’s permission for opposites to coexist without conflict.
