**Reaction** — the collapse of awareness in which the system defaults to survival logic and immediate regulation.

Reaction is not emotion.  
It is the moment awareness drops out of the field and the nervous system attempts to restore safety through speed, defense, or control.

In reaction:

- perception narrows
    
- interpretation accelerates
    
- the body contracts
    
- relief becomes the priority
    
- choice becomes unavailable
    

Reaction is not a failure of awareness.  
It is the **interruption** of awareness.

The system is not responding to present conditions as they are;  
it is responding to remembered threat through inherited patterns.

---

### **Structural Characteristics**

- Reaction compresses perception into urgency
    
- Interpretation replaces observation
    
- Fear governs movement
    
- Control replaces presence
    

The field of awareness collapses around a single objective: stabilization.

---

### **Framework Usage**

Reaction indicates:

- insufficient safety
    
- reduced capacity
    
- unresolved distortion
    
- inherited survival logic still active
    

It does not require correction.  
It reveals where awareness is not yet available.

---

### **Structural Summary**

Reaction is the system prioritizing relief over coherence.
