**Distorted Power** — the use of control, coercion, dominance, or emotional force to produce safety or stability in the absence of awareness.

Distorted power is not power itself but a **compensatory behaviour** that arises when a system cannot hold its internal state. Instead of regulating internally, the system attempts to regulate externally by shaping, managing, or constraining others.

This form of power originates in fear and instability, not authority. It presents as force, certainty, or dominance, but functions as an externalization of unmet capacity. Distorted power relies on pressure rather than alignment and collapses once awareness becomes available.

Within the framework, distorted power is the structural opposite of integrated power. Where power reflects awareness embodied, distorted power reflects awareness absent.

> Distorted power imitates authority; power requires none.
