**Architecture** — the structural conditions through which perception organizes experience.

Within the Stillhouse system, Architecture refers to how awareness relates to reality before interpretation, story, or control intervene. It describes the configuration of perception itself — what becomes visible, what is filtered, and what coherence or distortion is possible.

Architecture is not personal and not psychological. It is patterned.  
When coherent, perception aligns directly with cause and effect.  
When distorted, perception collapses into projection, narrative, or defense.

Architecture does not act. It reveals.
