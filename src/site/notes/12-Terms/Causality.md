**Causality** — the structural relationship through which conditions give rise to effects.

Causality is descriptive, not moral. It does not assign meaning, value, intention, or purpose. It describes how conditions propagate, whether or not they are recognized, understood, or accepted.

---

Causality operates independently of belief, awareness, or interpretation. Effects follow causes regardless of narrative, justification, or denial. When causal movement is uninterrupted, experience appears linear and coherent. When causal movement is interrupted or mediated, causality does not stop — it redirects.

Within the framework, causality is continuous.

---

Causality is frequently misread in human experience due to delayed effects, displaced consequences, and external mediation. These misreads give rise to interpretations such as randomness, injustice, fate, or exception. Within the framework, these interpretations reflect perceptual overlays rather than breaks in causal structure.

---

Causality is not determinism. The presence of causality does not imply inevitability, predictability, or absence of choice. Causality describes relationship between conditions, not fixed outcomes.

---

> Causality does not demand belief. It proceeds.
