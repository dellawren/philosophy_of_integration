**Freedom** — the experiential condition that emerges when awareness, perception, and action are no longer in conflict.

In the Stillhouse framework, freedom is not agency, autonomy, or escape from constraint. It is not a cause, capacity, or driving force. Freedom is the _absence of internal resistance_ within a causal sequence.

Freedom appears when control is no longer required, distortion is no longer active, and awareness can meet effect without defense or negotiation. It does not initiate change; it follows coherence.

Freedom is therefore not something exercised.  
It is something **revealed** when integration is complete.

> Freedom is not the power to choose — it is what remains when choice is no longer distorted.
