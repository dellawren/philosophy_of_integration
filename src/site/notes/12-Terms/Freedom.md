**Freedom** — the experiential condition that emerges when awareness, perception, and action are no longer in conflict.

In the framework, freedom is not agency, autonomy, or escape from constraint. It is not a cause, capacity, or driving force. Freedom is the _absence of internal resistance_ within a causal sequence.

Freedom appears when control is no longer required, distortion is no longer active, and awareness can meet effect without defense or negotiation. It does not initiate change; it follows coherence.

Freedom is therefore not something exercised.  
It is something **revealed** when integration is complete.

> Freedom is not the power to choose — it is what remains when choice is no longer distorted.
