**Chain Split** — the moment two chains exist simultaneously: the old (distorted) and the new (coherent), creating the first true moment of human choice.

Before the split, you cannot choose — you can only repeat the inherited architecture. The split opens the possibility of replacement. Emotion gives you the signal, awareness locates the distortion, and choice becomes available.

A chain split is the birth of agency. Not moral agency — structural agency.

> “Choice doesn’t happen before awareness. It happens because of it.”
