**Emotion** — the immediate internal effect produced by a causal chain.

Emotion is not identity, meaning, belief, or story.  
It is the system’s **direct physiological and affective registration** of what has occurred.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, emotion arises automatically when a cause is registered by the body.  
It appears quickly, signals the state of the chain, and resolves once its informational function is complete.

Emotion does not require interpretation.  
It does not instruct action.  
It does not define the self.

Distortion occurs only when emotion is claimed by identity, extended through narrative, or held in place by threat prediction. When this happens, emotion stops functioning as effect and becomes part of a looping structure.

In a coherent chain, emotion moves, completes, and exits without resistance.

Emotion is not something to manage or correct.  
It is something to **allow to register and pass**.
