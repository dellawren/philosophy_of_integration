## **Load Distribution** — the process by which causal strain is spread across multiple chains to maintain system stability.

Load Distribution refers to how a system allocates energetic and regulatory strain across more than one causal chain when a single sequence would be too costly to sustain. Rather than resolving the original cause, distributed chains reduce volatility and prevent collapse by sharing the burden of ongoing effects.

In the Integration framework, Load Distribution clarifies why secondary patterns persist long after their originating conditions have passed. These patterns are not resistance to change, but **structural support mechanisms** that remain active until the total system load decreases. Resolution occurs when distributed load is no longer required, not when individual chains are forcibly altered.
