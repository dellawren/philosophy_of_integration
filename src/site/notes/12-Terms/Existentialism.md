**Existentialism** — a philosophical position that places human freedom, choice, and responsibility at the center of existence in the absence of inherent or pre-given meaning.

Existentialism begins from the claim that life does not arrive with an assigned purpose. Meaning, value, and direction are understood as human constructions rather than objective features of reality. Within this view, individuals are responsible for how they act, choose, and relate to the conditions of their existence.

The tradition emphasizes agency and accountability, but often carries an implicit burden: the expectation that one must actively _create_ meaning in order for life to be justified or authentic. This can shift responsibility from action and consequence into narrative self-validation.

From the perspective of Integration, existentialism correctly identifies choice as central, but overextends meaning as a requirement. Integration treats meaning as optional rather than necessary. Coherence does not depend on narrative purpose, but on accurate participation in cause and effect.

Existence does not require justification.  
It only requires awareness.
