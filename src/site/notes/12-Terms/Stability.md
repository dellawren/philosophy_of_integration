**Stability** — the internal steadiness that comes from awareness, not from circumstance.

Stability in Integration isn’t external or guaranteed by conditions. It isn’t created by routines, incomes, relationships, or predictable lives. Stability is the quiet coherence that appears when fear stops dictating direction. It’s the capacity to meet what’s happening without collapsing into story or control.

In the conventional world, stability is a social marker. It is a state of internal alignment: the absence of internal argument with reality. You don’t achieve it by securing your life — you access it by trusting yourself to move through whatever arrives.

> “Stability is not the world holding still. It’s you no longer needing it to.”
