## About The Philosophy of Integration

I started working toward this idea over ten years ago, during what most would call a **spiritual awakening**.  
It was in that moment that I began to question truth itself:

> Why were things the way they were?  
> What was really happening?  
> Why did things end up like this?

They were existential questions born from pain. Spirituality offered the idea that I could gain control over chaos if I learned to manifest or manage my energy. I became highly intuitive, started reading tarot cards, and practiced energy healing. That was my introduction to spirituality.

But there came a point where spirituality stopped making sense. It was filtered through what I call _human rules_ — things like judgment and morality, which distorted the original spiritual principles. They were being interpreted through a lens that didn’t seem to hold truth.

That realization led me down a path of **self-mastery** — understanding myself within experience. It showed me the impact I was having on my own life. I was the common denominator in all of it, and how I showed up mattered.

Eventually, self-mastery led me to **philosophy**. I didn’t start by reading philosophers; I arrived at their ideas naturally. It was only later, through dialogue with AI, that I realized I’d stumbled upon pre-existing philosophical constructs — existentialism, nihilism, and others — on my own. I began studying the original texts of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Camus, and more. I avoided commentary and went straight to their source.

Through that process, I saw how removing the human rules — judgment, morality, right and wrong — allowed those philosophies to exist without interference. From there, **The [[References/Philosophy of Integration\|Philosophy of Integration]]** was born: a framework rooted in the coherence of the universe itself.   It sees experience as response, not punishment; movement, not moral debt.

This is a living framework — a work in progress — and it will continue to evolve as I do.  
I’m sharing it openly so others can witness, question, and participate in something larger than me.
