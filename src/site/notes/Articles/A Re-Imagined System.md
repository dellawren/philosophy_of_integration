The system is broken. Do you agree?

Let’s define it. The system is government, supply chains, and the way you get what you need to live. Your job is part of it. Healthcare, education, and housing are part of it. Money is part of it. The script you were handed for how your life should look is part of it. Reward and punishment, morality and religion — all part of the system.

The only thing not part of the system is you. You exist within it, but you are separate from it.

Who runs the system?

People. Individual people knowingly and intentionally perpetuate broken structures that create lack and struggle. And because people created it, it can be changed. The system is not natural. It is not inevitable. It is not permanent.

Continuing to struggle is a choice, not a requirement. Struggle was never meant to be part of your existence. Problems will always arise — but survival should not depend on them.

What stops us from changing the system?

Fear. Greed. Power. Control.

Those who gain power inside the system often want to reshape it in their own image — but only by moving the same broken pieces around. True change means something deeper.

Let’s be clear: the system must be destroyed and rebuilt from the bottom up.

### A Reimagined World

I believe food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, and education should be free.

- **Homes for all**: 200-square-foot bachelor pads for individuals; up to 400-square-foot homes for families.
- **Free primary and post-secondary education.**
- **Healthcare for everyone**: dental, eye, audiology, mental health, addiction services, prescriptions, therapy, preventative care, emergency care.
- **Free groceries**: a weekly ration of basics, including hygiene products, diapers, and formula, with the option to buy more.
- **Free clothing**: seasonal basics and outerwear, especially in cold climates.

How do we make this possible? By flattening the economy into a simple system of trade.

- Remove interest, taxes, stocks, depreciation, and appreciation.
- Make banks not-for-profit.
- Eliminate interest on existing loans and apply past payments back to the principal.
- Wipe out student loan debt.
- Take the cap off money itself: governments can create it freely, without taxing individuals first. Money is only a symbol of trade.

With this, every person receives a Universal Basic Income: a minimum of $2,000 per month, plus $500 per child. Work becomes a choice, not a requirement for survival. Government’s only role: managing distribution.

We remove systems of reward and punishment, close jails, and give people radical freedom.

Corporations no longer dodge taxes but give up to 25% of profit — before research and development — back to communities in free goods and services. Imagine Walmart providing for the people it serves, instead of hoarding wealth in loopholes.

Schools become hubs: food, clothing, medical and mental health care all under one roof. A structure that supports the whole child, not just their grades.

### The Truth About People

Some ideas behind the current system are simply false.

People aren’t lazy. They are stressed, overworked, and anxious. Take away survival pressure and they will naturally find fulfillment. Work isn’t valuable because it buys healthcare or rent. Work is valuable because it brings joy and purpose.

Not everyone wants the same life. Some dream of large homes and cars, others of simplicity. Let them choose — with a structure that supports that choice.

Morality is a lie. Right and wrong are human constructs, not universal truths. They are private guides, not public weapons. Religion, too, is personal, not systemic.

Radical freedom does not create chaos when people are supported. Violence and theft are born from scarcity. Remove survival from the equation, and freedom becomes natural.

Wealth itself is not wrong. Hoarding is a symptom of fear. When everyone is supported, the impulse to hoard fades. Being rich is unnecessary — because a rich life is available to all.

### The Bottom Line

It is possible to reimagine the system so that everyone is fully supported. There is no true lack. What we call lack is created by withholding, on purpose, through rules that serve the few.

The whole system is a lie.

It’s time to break free and begin to imagine the world again.

Love to all.
