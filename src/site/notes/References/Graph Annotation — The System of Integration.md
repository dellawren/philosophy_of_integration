This map is a visual expression of coherence.
Each node represents a principle within _The System of Integration_ — a living framework that traces how truth moves through awareness, ethics, and society.

The central cluster reveals _The Philosophy of Integration_ as the organizing field.  
Around it, the four great systems form a dialogue:

- _The Ladder of Integration_ rises through lived experience.
    
- _The Architecture of Perception_ opens awareness and sight.
    
- _The Machinery of Fragmentation_ exposes what breaks the whole.
    
- _The Vision for a Stable Society_ extends truth into structure.
    

Every line between them marks relationship — not hierarchy.  
The more links appear, the more coherent the philosophy becomes.

> This is not a web of control, but of connection — a map of how wholeness remembers itself.
