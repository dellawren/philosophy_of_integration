**Reality** — the movement that exists before interpretation.  
It is the raw event-level unfolding of life: what was said, what was done, what the body felt, what conditions occurred, and what consequences followed. Reality does not depend on belief, story, motive, or agreement. It is simply what happened.

In Integration, reality is not the “correct” angle or the “objective” view. It is the part of experience that requires no explanation — the layer of undeniable movement that appears before the mind adds meaning. Reality offers a ground for coherence not because it is morally superior, but because it does not shift with interpretation. It is the place where distortion ends and contact begins.

Unlike systemic notions of reality that rely on consensus, fact, or authority, Stillhouse reality is relational and immediate. It is the event itself, stripped of adjectives and assumptions. Naming reality restores clarity: not to determine who is right, but to stop replacing what occurred with a story about what it means.

No one outside the event can hold its truth, because perception is always shaped by position.  
Interpretation from the outside is not insight — it is interference.

> “Reality is the moment before the mind explains.”
