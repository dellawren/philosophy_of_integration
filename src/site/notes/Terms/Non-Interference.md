**Non-Interference** — the disciplined refusal to enter another person’s causal loop.  
It is the ethical posture of Integration: the choice to remain aligned with cause and effect rather than imposing interpretation, guidance, or correction.

Non-interference is not withdrawal, apathy, or indifference. It is clarity about positional sovereignty. Only the person inside an event has access to its truth; anyone outside introduces a foreign cause and slows the natural return of awareness. Non-interference is therefore not passive—it is fidelity to the architecture.

In Stillhouse philosophy, non-interference honours the self-resolving nature of fragmentation. It trusts consequence to reveal what the mind cannot, and it refuses to distort the loop with pressure, projection, or moral control.

> **“To interfere is to fragment. To stay outside the loop is to trust reality.”**
