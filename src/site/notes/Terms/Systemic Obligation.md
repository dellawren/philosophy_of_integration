**Systemic obligation** is the perceived duty to conform to the expectations, rules, or moral codes of a collective — family, culture, religion, or state — often at the expense of individual truth.  
It is the invisible weight of belonging: the internalized belief that safety, worth, and love must be earned through compliance.

Systemic obligation maintains order by suppressing divergence.  
It rewards predictability and punishes authenticity, mistaking obedience for coherence.

In the Stillhouse view, systemic obligation is not inherently evil — it’s simply the social expression of fear. It exists wherever awareness has been replaced by control.

> Systemic obligation asks, “Who must I be to stay safe?”
