**Responsibility** — awareness of one’s position within a causal sequence and the capacity to respond without distortion.

Responsibility is not obligation, guilt, duty, or moral burden. It does not require self-judgment or correction. Within the Philosophy of Integration, responsibility refers to the maintenance of awareness in the presence of cause and effect.

To be responsible is to recognize one’s participation in a chain without collapsing into blame, defense, or justification. It is the point at which awareness remains available long enough for consequence to be seen clearly and responded to coherently.

Responsibility replaces blame by removing moral overlay. It does not ask who is at fault; it identifies where awareness is located. When responsibility is present, reaction gives way to response and the chain is allowed to complete without interference.

Responsibility is therefore structural, not ethical in the moral sense. It is the condition that allows ethics to arise naturally from coherence rather than enforcement.
