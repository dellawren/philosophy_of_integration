**Responsibility** is the ability to respond with awareness rather than reaction.  
It is not burden, guilt, or duty — it is participation in cause and effect with consciousness intact.

In Stillhouse philosophy, responsibility replaces blame.  
It acknowledges impact without attaching shame.  
To be responsible is to remain present in the pattern — to see one’s role within consequence and choose coherence over defense.

> Responsibility is awareness in motion.
