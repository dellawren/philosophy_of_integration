**Axis of Awareness — the movement between Creation and Reflection that forms the core of conscious participation in reality.**  
The axis is the internal pivot where awareness chooses how to engage with cause and effect. It is not a moral mechanism or a behavioural tool — it is the point where perception becomes movement.

The axis has two directions:

- **Creation** — how awareness enters the world
    
- **Reflection** — how the world returns awareness to itself
    

The axis stays stable only when the nervous system is not in threat mode. When fear takes over, the axis collapses into reaction. When safety returns, awareness reopens, and the axis becomes available again.

The axis is not something you “use.” It is something you _recognize_. Once recognized, it becomes the simplest way to understand where you are positioned within any loop of experience.
