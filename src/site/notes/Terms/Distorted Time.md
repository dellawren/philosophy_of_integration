**Distorted Time** — the alteration of temporal experience that occurs when the chain bends under overwhelm and awareness becomes unavailable.

Distorted time is not about memory failure or psychological confusion. It is the system reorganizing itself around survival. When an experience exceeds capacity, the chain cannot process it in sequence. Time collapses, stretches, freezes, or loops. The moment becomes unmoored from continuity and persists as if it were still happening.

This distortion creates the sensation of being pulled backward or suspended. It fuels looping memory, reactive interpretation, trauma identity, and hypervigilance. The system is not stuck — it simply has not completed the internal event. Distorted time resolves when the chain closes and the moment returns to its rightful place in sequence.

In Integration, distorted time is recognized as architectural, not emotional. It is the temporal imprint of an incomplete loop.
