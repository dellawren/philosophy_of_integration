**Emotional Feedback** — the body’s interpretive report of the chain’s state.

Emotion isn’t truth — it’s information. It tells you where the chain is coherent, where it’s bent, and where a loop has formed. Emotional discomfort is not a flaw; it’s a diagnostic tool.

In Integration, emotion becomes guidance. Instead of trying to regulate, suppress, or indulge feelings, you read them as feedback from the architecture.

> “Your body is not betraying you — it’s reporting the truth the mind won’t name.”
