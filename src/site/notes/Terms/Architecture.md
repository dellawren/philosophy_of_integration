**Architecture** — the structural intelligence through which perception forms reality.

Within The Stillhouse system, the Architecture describes how awareness and truth interrelate — the scaffolding of perception itself. It’s not just how we _see_ but how we _make meaning_. When the Architecture is coherent, awareness perceives truth directly. When fragmented, perception collapses into distortion and projection.

Unlike the Machinery, which reacts, the Architecture reveals. It’s the transparent framework of Integration — showing that perception isn’t personal; it’s patterned.

> “The world doesn’t change when you see it differently — it changes because seeing is creation itself.”
