**Fear** is awareness constricted by uncertainty.  
It arises when the mind encounters what it cannot predict and mistakes the unknown for danger.

Fear is not an enemy — it is information.  
It reveals where the self still seeks control instead of trust, where the story of safety overrides the truth of experience.

In Stillhouse philosophy, fear is not the opposite of courage but the doorway to awareness.  
It signals fragmentation, inviting integration.  
When fear is met rather than managed, it transforms from contraction into clarity.

> Fear is the boundary between perception and truth.
