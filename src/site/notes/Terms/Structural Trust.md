**Structural Trust** — the recognition that cause and effect is sufficient and that no external control is necessary or coherent.  
It is trust in the architecture, not in people; trust in consequence, not in correction; trust in the self-resolving nature of awareness, not in external management.

Structural Trust replaces moral authority, behavioral control, and imposed guidance. It affirms that fragmentation resolves itself naturally when interference is removed. This trust is not naïve or permissive—it is the only stance consistent with a universe that functions through relational consequence.

In Integration, Structural Trust is the metaphysical foundation of ethics. It asserts that the architecture of reality is complete, coherent, and self-balancing, and that all attempts to “improve” or “manage” it generate new fragmentation.
