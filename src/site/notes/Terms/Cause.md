**Cause** is the initiating movement of relationship — the impulse that sets reality in motion.  
It is not intention or desire, but the act of participation itself: awareness meeting form.

In Stillhouse philosophy, cause is not personal. It arises from interaction, not ownership.  
Every cause exists within a web of others, unfolding through the field of consequence that connects all things.

Cause is the seed of [[Terms/Coherence\|coherence]] — it begins the rhythm that effect completes.  
When understood without ego, it reveals responsibility without blame.

> Cause is creation remembering itself in motion.
