**Boundaries** — the recognition of where responsibility ends, where choice begins, and where another person’s internal state is not yours to manage.

Boundaries are not walls or punishments. They are the natural shape of awareness when the self is no longer trying to control or be controlled. A boundary forms wherever coherence meets distortion — the line where you remain responsible for your own cause and effect but refuse to carry someone else’s collapse. It isn’t separation; it’s clarity.

In Integration, boundaries arise from presence, not fear. They do not restrict other people. They orient you. A boundary simply states: _this is mine to hold, and that is yours._ When awareness is stable, boundaries become effortless because they reflect the internal state rather than defend it. They mark the point at which you stop negotiating with distortion and start living from truth.

> A boundary is not a barrier — it is the space where coherence breathes.
