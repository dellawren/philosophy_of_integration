**Boundaries** — the structural limit of responsibility within a causal system; the point at which one person’s cause and effect ends and another’s begins.

A boundary is not a rule, defense, or interpersonal tactic.  
It is an **orientation marker** within awareness that differentiates internal responsibility from external influence. Boundaries indicate what a system can coherently hold without entering distortion.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, boundaries arise when awareness is stable enough to register responsibility accurately. They do not regulate others and do not require enforcement. A boundary does not act on the external environment; it **locates the self** within the chain.

Boundaries are not separation.  
They are the absence of interference.

Where boundaries are unclear, control attempts appear.  
Where boundaries are coherent, interaction stabilizes without negotiation.

> A boundary marks where responsibility ends, not where connection breaks.
