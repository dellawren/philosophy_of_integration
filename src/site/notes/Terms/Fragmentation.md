**Fragmentation** — the temporary separation between awareness and reality.  
It occurs when internal cause (story, fear, pressure, expectation) becomes louder than the event itself. Fragmentation is not failure, pathology, or error—it is a natural phase in the causal arc.

In Integration, fragmentation resolves itself through consequence. As the results of distortion unfold, awareness eventually meets reality again, and coherence restores. Intervention delays this process by introducing a foreign cause that the person must react to. Fragmentation lasts only as long as the mind resists the moment.

Fragmentation is therefore not something to fix, correct, or guide someone out of. It is a condition that ends on its own when the causal loop completes. Every attempt to accelerate awareness from the outside becomes part of the fragmentation.
