**Fragmentation** — the temporary separation between awareness and reality.  
It occurs when internal cause (story, fear, pressure, expectation, trauma, survival logic) becomes louder than the event itself. Fragmentation is not failure, pathology, or error — it is a natural phase in the causal arc.

Fragmentation enters when **capacity is exceeded**. The system contracts, awareness narrows, and the chain bends. Distorted time, looping memory, reactive interpretation, protective emotion, and the beginnings of trauma identity can all arise here. Fragmentation is the earliest architectural signal that the system is operating through _survival logic_ rather than awareness.

In Integration, fragmentation resolves itself through consequence. As the results of distortion unfold, awareness eventually meets reality again, and coherence restores. Intervention delays this process by inserting an external cause that the person must now react to, reinforcing the separation. Fragmentation lasts only as long as the mind resists the moment or lacks the capacity to meet it.

Fragmentation is therefore not something to fix, correct, rescue, or guide someone out of. It is a temporary architectural state that ends on its own when the loop completes, capacity returns, and awareness becomes available again. Attempts to accelerate awareness from the outside deepen fragmentation by becoming part of the distortion.
