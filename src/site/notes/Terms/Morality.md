**Morality** is a human construct designed to enforce order through conformity.  
It replaces awareness with obedience by defining behaviour as good or bad, right or wrong, based on collective fear rather than individual truth.

Morality does not emerge from consciousness — it is imposed upon it.  
It seeks safety through sameness, stability through suppression, and virtue through control.  
Its goal is not coherence, but predictability.

In the Stillhouse view, morality is the outer scaffolding built when inner coherence has not yet been cultivated.  
It is a substitute for awareness, a framework of “shoulds” that attempts to replace direct understanding of cause and effect.  
Where ethics evolve from truth, morality evolves from fear.

> Morality governs through guilt; awareness governs through responsibility.
