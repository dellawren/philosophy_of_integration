**Morality** is a human construct designed to enforce order through conformity.  
It replaces awareness with obedience by defining behaviour as good or bad, right or wrong — not through truth, but through collective fear.

Morality does not emerge from consciousness; it is imposed upon it.  
It seeks safety through sameness, stability through suppression, and virtue through control.  
Its goal is not coherence, but predictability.

In the Stillhouse view, morality is the _distorted lens_ that appears when awareness of natural cause and effect has been lost.  

It functions as a **translation layer** — an attempt to recreate balance through external rules when internal coherence is absent.  

Where [[Terms/Ethics\|ethics]] serves as an instrument to restore alignment, morality becomes the imitation of it.

> Morality governs through guilt; awareness governs through responsibility.
