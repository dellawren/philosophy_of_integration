**Emotion** — the immediate effect generated by the chain in response to a cause.  
It is not identity, meaning, or story. It is the body’s real-time registration of consequence.

Emotion appears the moment the chain interprets a cause. It rises quickly, communicates the internal state, and dissipates once its function is complete. Emotion becomes distorted only when identity or story claims it. In a coherent chain, emotion is information — nothing more and nothing less.

Emotion cannot be corrected, suppressed, transcended, or moralized without reinforcing distortion. It completes on its own when awareness is available and the chain is not held in place by narrative or fear.

> Emotion is effect. Identity is choice.
