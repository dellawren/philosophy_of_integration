**Replacing the Chain** — the structural shift in which a distorted causal architecture is superseded by a coherent one through withdrawal of participation.

Within the framework, replacement is not repair, healing, or transformation of the existing chain.  
It is the **cessation of reinforcement** of one architecture and the **adoption of another** that is aligned with present reality.

A chain is replaced when its interpretation is no longer treated as true.  
The old architecture does not resolve; it becomes obsolete.

### **Framework Usage**

Replacing the chain explains:

- why change can occur without processing the entire past
    
- why distorted patterns collapse without effort once coherence is available
    
- why repetition ends abruptly rather than gradually
    
- why integration does not require fixing what formed under different conditions
    

Replacement occurs at the level of **interpretation**, not behaviour.

### **Structural Notes**

- Distorted chains persist through participation
    
- Coherent chains persist through alignment
    
- When participation stops, the old chain loses function
    
- When alignment is present, the new chain carries continuity
    

Replacement is immediate once the system recognizes which architecture is coherent.
