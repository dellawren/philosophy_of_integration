**Replacing the Chain** — the act of shifting from a distorted architecture to a coherent one by choosing a new interpretation aligned with truth, allowing the old chain to fall out of use through non-participation.

Replacing the chain is not repair and it is not healing. It is the structural act of moving from one causal architecture to another. The old chain doesn’t resolve or transform; it simply loses power when you stop reinforcing it. Replacement happens when awareness sees the distortion clearly enough that it no longer accepts the loop’s interpretation as truth.

In Integration, this is the core mechanism of transformation. You do not rebuild the old architecture. You choose the interpretation that reflects truth, and the distorted chain collapses from disuse. Replacement is fast, clean, and decisive — not because you force the shift, but because coherence carries no loop.
