**Memory** — the record of previous chains held in the system, not as story, but as stored consequence. Memory is not the past; it is the architecture the past created.

Memory forms when an experience completes and returns to sequence. The system stores the resolved loop as information — neutral, accessible, and free of charge. But when an experience does _not_ complete, memory does not settle into the past. It remains active, charged, looping, and capable of colouring the present through distorted time and reactive interpretation.

Memory is therefore not inherently emotional. Emotion belongs to the moment that has not yet closed. Once awareness returns and the chain completes, the emotional charge dissolves and memory becomes structural knowledge. Memory is simply the architecture of what the system has already survived and integrated.

In Integration, memory is neither threat nor identity. It is neutral data. Trauma is what happens when memory cannot return to neutrality.
