**Distortion Loop** — the internal circuit inside a bent chain that reroutes awareness, emotion, and behaviour back into the old pattern.

A distortion loop forms when an inherited or protective interpretation overrides the present moment. Instead of allowing cause and effect to move cleanly, the loop feeds awareness back into the same interpretation, creating circular thinking, emotional repetition, and patterned behaviour.

In Integration, a distortion loop is not a flaw; it’s a survival architecture that kept the system stable when coherence wasn’t available. Its purpose was continuity. Its consequence is stagnation.
