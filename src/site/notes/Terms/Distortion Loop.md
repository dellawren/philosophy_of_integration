**Distortion Loop** — the self-reinforcing internal circuit inside a bent chain where awareness, emotion, memory, and interpretation feed back into the same protective architecture instead of moving forward.

A distortion loop forms when the chain cannot complete its causal arc.  
Instead of:

**Cause → Effect → Awareness → Choice**

the system reroutes into:

**Cause → Effect ↺ Interpretation → Emotion → Identity → Protective Behaviour → Altered Cause**

The loop replaces movement with repetition.  
It keeps awareness orbiting old information — trauma, memory, narrative, fear, boundaries that collapsed or overextended — instead of allowing the present moment to shape consequence.

Distortion loops are not malfunctions.  
They are **survival architecture** created when capacity was exceeded, neutrality was unavailable, or the narrative self needed continuity more than truth. The loop stabilizes the system by repeating what once protected it.

Its purpose is safety.  
Its consequence is stagnation.

A distortion loop ends only when something in the architecture changes:

- the memory becomes neutral
    
- the interpretation is replaced
    
- the emotional backlog completes
    
- identity releases meaning
    
- boundaries return to coherence
    
- awareness expands enough to see the pattern
    
- a new chain becomes possible
    

You cannot correct a loop — you outgrow it.  
The moment the architecture changes, the loop dissolves.

> Patterns don’t anchor you in truth — they anchor you in history.
