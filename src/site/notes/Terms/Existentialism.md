**Existentialism** — a philosophy that centres human freedom, choice, and responsibility in a world without inherent meaning.  
It begins with the recognition that life does not come pre-assigned with purpose, and that each person must decide how to live — consciously and authentically — within that truth.

Existentialism encourages self-awareness and personal agency, but it often becomes heavy when “creating meaning” turns into another form of pressure or self-judgment. People feel responsible not just for their choices, but for justifying their existence.

Through the lens of Integration, existentialism is valuable for its recognition of choice — but meaning is optional. Integration removes the burden to _make life meaningful_ and replaces it with coherence.

> You don’t need meaning to exist — you only need awareness to live.
