Reincarnation isn’t a sentence; it’s a choice.  
Consciousness returns to form not because it must, but because it _can._  
It’s the spirit’s curiosity — the desire to feel, learn, and create through matter again.

The soul isn’t striving to escape the cycle; it’s exploring its own reflection through infinite lives, refining awareness until it recognizes itself everywhere.

> We come back not to pay for the past, but to play with possibility.
