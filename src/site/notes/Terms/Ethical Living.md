**Ethical living** is coherence in motion — the daily embodiment of alignment between what is true, what is seen, and what is done.  

It is not compliance with moral rules; it is participation in truth.

To live ethically is to act in conscious relationship with [[Terms/Cause and Effect\|Cause and Effect]].  
It is neither perfection nor purity — it is responsiveness.  
Each choice becomes an act of awareness rather than reaction or obligation.

Ethical living does not require consensus or validation; it requires presence.  
It is the quiet knowing that alignment itself sustains balance without external enforcement.

> Ethical living is not about being good — it’s about being whole.
