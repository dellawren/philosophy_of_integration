**Fidelity** — unwavering alignment with the architecture of reality.  
It is the commitment to stay with what is true, not by belief or effort, but by refusing to distort the causal field with interference, projection, or control.

In Integration, fidelity is not loyalty to a person, system, or ideology.  
It is loyalty to _structure_: the recognition that cause and effect is sufficient, that awareness is positional, and that interference fragments the loop it tries to manage. Fidelity is the discipline of allowing reality to unfold without inserting foreign causes.

Fidelity expresses itself through non-interference, structural trust, and coherent presence. It is the opposite of correction, moralizing, or forcing clarity. To act with fidelity is to trust the self-resolving nature of fragmentation and honour the sovereignty of each causal position.

Fidelity is not passive. It is the active refusal to override truth with fear.  
It is the posture that holds the field steady so coherence can reveal itself.

> **“Fidelity is trust made visible — the choice to let reality do its work.”**
