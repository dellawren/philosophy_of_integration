**Integration** is the unification of awareness with experience — the process of bringing all aspects of self, perception, and reality into coherent relationship.

It does not seek perfection, healing, or transcendence, but **wholeness**: the ability to hold opposites without conflict.  
Integration allows pain and peace, logic and emotion, body and consciousness to coexist without hierarchy.

In the Stillhouse view, integration is not something the self achieves — it’s something that reveals itself when resistance ends.  
It is the moment when judgment dissolves and the fragments of experience find their natural order.

Integration is therefore not an act of fixing, but of **allowing**.  
Through integration, truth becomes lived rather than known.

> Integration is not perfection — it’s permission for opposites to coexist without conflict.
