**Awareness** is consciousness perceiving itself.  
It is the quiet witness beneath reaction — the state in which truth, emotion, and thought become visible without judgment.

Awareness is not focus or attention; it precedes both.  
In Stillhouse philosophy, awareness is the field in which integration occurs.  
It allows all things to be seen, not to change them, but to understand their place in the whole.

> Awareness is the stillness beneath perception.
