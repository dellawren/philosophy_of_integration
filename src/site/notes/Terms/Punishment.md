**Punishment** is the externalization of guilt — society’s attempt to restore imagined order through control.  
It is rooted in the belief that suffering can balance a moral equation, that pain can correct truth.

Punishment assumes separation: wrongdoer and victim, good and evil, power and submission.  
It denies integration by making pain a requirement for redemption, ensuring that control — not awareness — remains the governing force.

> Punishment is how systems mimic consequence without understanding cause and effect.

In The Stillhouse view, consequence is natural, not moral. Cause and effect operate without judgment; they are self-correcting through awareness.  
Punishment intervenes in that process, replacing evolution with enforcement.
