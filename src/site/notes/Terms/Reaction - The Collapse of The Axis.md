It is what happens when awareness falls out of the field and the body defaults to survival logic. Reaction isn’t emotion; it’s the moment the nervous system abandons presence and tries to regain safety through speed, defense, or control.

Reaction is not a failure of awareness — it is the interruption of it.  
It bends perception around fear, shrinking the field until only one thing matters: relief. The mind moves fast, the body tightens, and the story takes over. In reaction, creation stops and reflection distorts. The axis between them collapses into a single point: escape.

In Integration, reaction isn’t something to avoid; it’s something to recognize.  
Every collapse reveals where safety has not yet been established, where truth is still filtered through old patterns, or where the system still tries to manage what it hasn’t yet learned to see.

> “Reaction is the body remembering an old story before awareness has a chance to speak.”
