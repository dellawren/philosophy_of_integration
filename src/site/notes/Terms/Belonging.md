The recognition of inclusion within the field of being; the felt sense that nothing has fallen outside the whole.

Belonging is not permission granted by others but awareness rediscovered within the self. Systems define belonging as acceptance into a group; Integration reveals it as a natural condition that never depended on approval.

To belong is to recognize that separation was only perception. When awareness returns to coherence, belonging reappears as the quiet truth that you were never alone in the first place.
