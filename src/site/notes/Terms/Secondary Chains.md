## **Secondary Chains** — regulatory causal sequences that distribute or contain the effects of primary chains.

Secondary Chains form to manage the load generated by Primary Chains. They do not resolve the originating conditions. They **reduce volatility**, increase predictability, and allow the system to continue functioning while primary effects remain active.

In the Integration framework, Secondary Chains explain why patterns such as people-pleasing, control, hyper-independence, or emotional suppression persist long after their original context has changed. These chains are not defensive strategies in the psychological sense. They are **load-sharing mechanisms** that prevent primary chains from firing continuously.

Secondary Chains often generalize across contexts because they have proven effective at reducing activation. They decay only when they are no longer structurally necessary. Attempting to remove them prematurely increases strain and destabilizes the system.
