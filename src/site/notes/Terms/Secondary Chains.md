**Secondary Chains** — causal sequences that regulate, distribute, or contain the effects of an active primary chain.

Secondary chains do not originate experience. They form in response to it. Their function is to manage intensity, reduce volatility, and maintain system continuity while primary causal effects remain unresolved.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, secondary chains explain the persistence of patterned behaviours across changing contexts. They operate as load-distribution mechanisms, absorbing excess activation so the system can continue functioning without constant primary-chain discharge.

Secondary chains do not resolve causality. They stabilize it. They remain active only as long as they are structurally necessary and decay when the originating conditions no longer require regulation.

Secondary chains are functional, not defensive, and should not be removed through interference. Premature disruption increases systemic strain and destabilization.
