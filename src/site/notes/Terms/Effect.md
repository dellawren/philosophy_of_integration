**Effect** — the registered outcome of a cause within a causal sequence.

Effect is not an ending, consequence, or punishment.  
It is the **registration point** where a cause becomes observable within the system.

In the Philosophy of Integration, effect is the moment a movement is revealed to awareness.  
It shows what a cause has produced without interpretation, intention, or moral overlay.  
Effect is informational. It does not instruct, correct, or evaluate.

Effect may appear internally (emotion, sensation, memory) or externally (response, event, circumstance).  
Its form depends on where the chain is being registered, not on the meaning assigned to it.

When awareness is available, effect functions as feedback within cause and effect.  
When awareness is unavailable, effect may be misread as fate, threat, or external force.

Effect does not create the chain.  
It makes the chain visible.
