**Effect** is the continuation of cause — the expression that completes a cycle of movement.  
It is the mirror through which cause becomes visible, turning invisible intention into tangible form.

In Stillhouse philosophy, effect is not the end of a sequence but the revelation within it.  
It shows what has been set in motion, not as judgment, but as reflection.

When met with awareness, effect becomes feedback — a living conversation with reality.  
When met with resistance, it appears as fate.

> Effect is the universe showing you what you’ve made.
