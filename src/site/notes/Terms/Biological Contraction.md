**Biological Contraction** — the body’s immediate narrowing of capacity when an experience exceeds what the system can process. It is the physical expression of a chain bending under overwhelm.

Biological contraction is not stress, tension, or anxiety. It is the body collapsing inward to protect the system when awareness is momentarily unavailable. Muscles tighten, breath shortens, sensation distorts, and the nervous system shifts into urgency. The contraction is automatic. It does not ask permission and it does not require meaning.

This contraction is the first signal that the chain has moved out of coherence. It often precedes distorted time, looping memory, protective emotion, and reactive interpretation. Biological contraction is the body’s way of saying, _“This is too much for the current capacity.”_ It is not a failure — it is precision.

In Integration, biological contraction is treated as architecture, not emotion. Once capacity returns, the contraction releases on its own, restoring neutrality, breath, and the ability to meet the moment rather than brace against it.
