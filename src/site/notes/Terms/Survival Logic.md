**Survival Logic** — the reasoning produced inside a distorted chain that feels moral, necessary, or selfless, but is actually protective architecture.

Survival logic feels rational, noble, or inevitable, but it’s always the voice of the loop. It explains why you “must” stay small, compliant, silent, pleasing, or over-responsible. Survival logic is not thought — it’s distortion dressed as reason.

Integration exposes survival logic as architecture masquerading as identity. Once the distortion is replaced, the logic dissolves.

> “The chain can sound like wisdom when it’s really fear.”
