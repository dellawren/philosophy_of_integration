The aesthetic rhythm of coherence expressed through relationship, sound, colour, or form.

Harmony is balance made audible — the way truth feels when it moves beautifully.  
It is not perfection or agreement, but resonance: distinct parts vibrating within the same field without cancelling each other out.

In Integration, harmony is how coherence becomes sensory. It allows difference to exist without discord and reveals that beauty is simply the recognition of coherence through perception.

> “Harmony is coherence you can feel.”
