**Power** is the natural flow of agency through awareness.  
It is not dominance or control — it is coherence expressed as movement.

When fragmented, power becomes possession: the attempt to contain or wield life rather than participate in it.  
When integrated, power becomes presence — effortless influence born from alignment with truth.

In Stillhouse philosophy, true power is self-sustaining because it doesn’t require control.  
It acts, not to dominate, but to restore balance through clarity.

> Power is not what you take — it’s what moves through you when you stop resisting.
