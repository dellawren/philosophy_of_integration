**Victimization** is the ongoing identification with harm as identity.  
It begins in truth — an event of power imbalance — but persists as illusion when one remains bound to the story rather than the self.

Victimization replaces the original wound with a role.  
It grants moral innocence at the cost of freedom, demanding others stay cast as villain or saviour to maintain the narrative of helplessness.

> Healing begins when awareness replaces the story — when power is reclaimed as the ability to respond, not react.
