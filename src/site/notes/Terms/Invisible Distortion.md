**Invisible Distortion** — a distortion that remains undetected because it produces stability rather than disruption.

In the Stillhouse framework, distortion is not invisible because it is unconscious, repressed, or hidden from awareness. It is invisible because it is _functional_. As long as a distorted chain produces predictable outcomes, preserves belonging, or maintains regulation, it does not register as distortion within the system.

Visibility is not determined by truth.  
It is determined by cost.

An invisible distortion is a causal pattern whose consequences remain below the system’s threshold for disruption. The chain may be misaligned with present reality, but because it still “works,” awareness has no reason to interrogate it. The pattern is experienced as normal operation rather than distortion.

Invisible distortions therefore tend to be:

- structurally stabilizing
    
- socially reinforced
    
- identity-consistent
    
- morally justified
    
- predictively reliable
    

These qualities do not make the chain coherent. They make it _undetected_.

Distortion becomes visible only when accumulated cost exceeds the system’s compensatory capacity. Collapse, conflict, exhaustion, relational failure, or loss of regulation do not create distortion — they reveal it.

Invisible distortion does not require interpretation to persist.  
It requires only continued function.
