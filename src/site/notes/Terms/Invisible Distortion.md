**Invisible Distortion** — a distortion that produces stability, identity, belonging, approval, or predictability, and therefore hides inside the appearance of coherence.

These distortions don’t feel like distortions because they reward you. They create consistency in your relationships, your role, or your sense of self. But they still bend the chain, separating awareness from truth.

Invisible distortions are the most dangerous because they masquerade as alignment. They often appear virtuous, selfless, reliable, or “good,” even when they cost you coherence.
