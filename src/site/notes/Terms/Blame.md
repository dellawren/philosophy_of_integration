**Blame** is resistance to consequence.  
It’s the mind’s attempt to outsource responsibility, to find a story that explains pain without requiring awareness.

Blame divides: self from other, action from effect, truth from accountability.  
It creates moral hierarchies — innocence and guilt — instead of seeing the continuity of cause and effect.

In Stillhouse philosophy, blame dissolves when consequence is accepted without judgment.  
It is replaced by responsibility — not in the punitive sense, but as ownership of participation in the whole.

> Blame ends where awareness begins.
