**Self-mastery** — the conscious awareness of one’s inner experience and the ability to respond from truth rather than reactivity.

Self-mastery begins with learning to observe your thoughts, emotions, and behaviours without collapsing into them. At first, it may look like managing impulses or redirecting reactions — not as suppression, but as a way of staying connected to yourself. Over time, this shifts from management to alignment: choice grounded in awareness rather than effort.

In Integration, self-mastery is not control — it is participation with oneself.

> True self-mastery is not the tightening of the reins, but the softening into truth.
