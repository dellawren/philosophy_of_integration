**Capacity** — the system’s ability to hold experience without collapsing into distortion, story, or survival logic.

Capacity is not strength, resilience, or emotional skill. It is the amount of awareness available at any given moment. When capacity is high, the chain can process intensity, consequence, truth, and memory without bending. When capacity is low, even small experiences can overwhelm the architecture and trigger contraction.

Capacity fluctuates. It widens with coherence and narrows with trauma, exhaustion, fear, fragmentation, or overload. When capacity drops below the threshold an experience requires, distortion enters the chain: time splits, memory loops, survival logic activates, and the system reorganizes around protection rather than truth.

In Integration, capacity becomes one of the clearest indicators of where the system actually is. It is never a moral measure. It simply tells the truth about whether awareness is available. Trauma dissolves and coherence stabilizes when capacity returns — because the system can finally hold what it once had to survive.

> “Trauma enters where capacity ends. Integration begins where capacity returns.”
