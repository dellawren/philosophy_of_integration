**Reactive Interpretation** — the meaning the system generates when awareness is unavailable and the chain is being driven by survival logic instead of truth.

Reactive interpretation is not perception; it is protection. When the system is overwhelmed, contracted, or fragmented, it fills in gaps with fear, memory, assumption, or story logic. The interpretation appears accurate because it stabilizes the moment emotionally, not because it reflects reality.

This kind of interpretation is fast, convincing, and self-reinforcing. It loops with distorted time, looping memory, and protective emotion, creating an experience that feels true even when it has little connection to the present moment. Reactive interpretation dissolves when capacity returns and awareness can meet the event directly.

In Integration, reactive interpretation is understood as architecture, not identity. It is the system attempting to organize uncertainty into something survivable.
