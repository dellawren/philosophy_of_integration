**Approval Loop** — the internal circuit where a person uses external validation to stabilize a distorted chain, reinforcing both the identity built around approval and the distortion that created it.

An approval loop forms when belonging, connection, or safety depended on performing correctly for someone else — a parent, a partner, a community, a system. Over time, the nervous system learns to treat approval as evidence of coherence, even though approval has nothing to do with truth. This creates a loop: perform → receive approval → feel temporarily regulated → repeat. The loop feels stabilizing, but it is actually the mechanism that keeps the distortion alive.

In Integration, the approval loop is seen not as a personality trait or insecurity, but as structural inheritance. It is the architecture of survival continuing to run long after the environment that required it has changed. The loop dissolves not by refusing approval, nor by seeking confidence, but by replacing the chain that made approval necessary in the first place.

> “Approval feels like connection only when you’ve never known connection without performance.”
