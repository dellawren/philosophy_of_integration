**Obligation** is the performance of responsibility without awareness.  
It is what remains when truth is replaced by expectation — when choice becomes debt.

Obligation arises from fear of consequence or loss of belonging.  
It is the system’s quiet coercion: “If you don’t, you’re wrong.”  
Underneath, it carries the residue of control — the belief that compliance preserves safety, and that goodness can be earned through obedience.

In Stillhouse philosophy, obligation is not responsibility’s twin but its distortion.  
Where responsibility is awareness in motion, obligation is awareness contained.  
One responds; the other conforms.  
Freedom begins when the performance of obligation is seen for what it is — an inherited story of survival masquerading as virtue.

> Obligation is the ghost of belonging — proof that fear still writes the script.
