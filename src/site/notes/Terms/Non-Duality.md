**Non-Duality** is the recognition that separation is an illusion and that all things are expressions of one continuous whole.  
At its core, non-duality dissolves the boundaries between self and other, inner and outer, human and divine.  
Everything belongs because nothing is separate.

Non-duality offers profound peace, but when held as a belief instead of a realization, it can bypass the human experience.  
It may dismiss individuality, emotion, and relationship as “illusion,” invalidating the very realm through which awareness evolves.

In [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]], non-duality is acknowledged as a truth of being while still honouring the reality of being human.  
Integration includes both the self and the whole — the personal and the universal — without erasing either.

> Oneness without humanity is escape; oneness with humanity is integration.
