**Non-Duality** — the recognition that separation is an illusion and that all things are expressions of one continuous whole.  
At its core, non-duality dissolves the boundaries between self and other, inner and outer, human and divine. Everything belongs because nothing is separate.

Non-duality offers profound peace, but when used as a belief rather than a realization, it can bypass the human experience. It can dismiss individuality, emotion, and relationship as “illusion,” invalidating the reality that humans must live within.

[[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] acknowledges non-duality as a truth of being — while still honouring the reality of being human. It includes the self and the whole, the personal and the universal, without erasing either.

> Oneness without humanity is escape; oneness with humanity is integration.
