## **Chain Coupling** — the structural linkage of multiple causal chains that synchronize and influence one another.

Chain Coupling describes how causal chains connect rather than operate independently. When conditions exceed a system’s capacity, a single chain is often insufficient to contain the resulting effects. Additional chains form and become **coupled**, meaning activity in one chain alters the behavior, timing, or load of another.

Within the Integration framework, Chain Coupling explains why trauma rarely appears as a single pattern. Primary and secondary chains link together to form a functional architecture that maintains coherence under strain. These couplings persist until upstream conditions change, at which point the links loosen and chains begin to resolve hierarchically.

> “Chains rarely break in isolation; they release each other.”
