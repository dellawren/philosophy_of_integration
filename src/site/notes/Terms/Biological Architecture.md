**Biological Architecture** — the mirrored pattern of how the body rewires itself through replacement, not repair.

The body does not repair distorted emotional architecture by fixing the old circuitry. It rewires through new pathways formed by coherent participation. This mirrors the chain: distortion is not corrected; it is replaced.

This biological architecture explains why Integration works — feelings move differently when the underlying pattern changes. Biology follows coherence the way vines follow light.

> “The body reorganizes when the architecture does.”
