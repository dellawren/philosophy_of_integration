**Safety** is the perception of stability within experience.  
It is not the absence of threat, but the nervous system’s recognition that awareness can stay open without harm.

In Stillhouse philosophy, safety is both biological and existential.  
It is the bridge between fear and awareness — the space where the body learns that truth does not endanger it.

Control tries to manufacture safety through predictability; integration restores it through trust.  
True safety arises when fear is understood, not removed.  
It is what allows the self to stop defending and start perceiving.

> Safety is the body’s permission for awareness to remain.
