### _Freedom inside the field, not outside the chain_

**Situated determinism** is the understanding that every human action arises from two streams of cause:  
the causes that shape us _(external)_ and the causes we generate _(internal)_.  
Nothing we do appears outside these conditions — but awareness creates openness within them.

In Integration, determinism is not a cage.  
It is the **field of inevitability** within which freedom becomes possible.  
Conditions shape the moment, but awareness shapes the movement.

## **The Core Principle**

**Everything is caused, but not everything is fixed.**  
Cause and effect determine the structure,  
but awareness determines the trajectory inside that structure.

Freedom does not break the chain.  
It **bends** it.

Freedom does not originate the cause.  
It **shapes** the effect.

## **Two Streams of Influence**

### **External Conditions**

Biology, history, upbringing, trauma, social forces, structural inequity, and the world as it acts on you.  
These cannot be chosen or avoided.  
They set the constraints and define what is possible in a given moment.

### **Internal Conditions**

Emotion, thought, impulse, nervous-system pattern, memory, belief, habit.  
These arise without permission but generate new effects in the field.  
They are the beginning of personal participation in the chain.

Situated determinism sees both as real and inescapable —  
and sees awareness as the bridge between them.

## **The Location of Freedom**

Freedom does not live in the **cause** (internal or external).  
It lives in the **effect**:

> **Freedom is the openness in how you meet what arises.  
> Not an escape from cause, but movement within it.**

Choice is not a rebellion against inevitability.  
Choice is how the self participates in inevitability with awareness.

## **A Middle Philosophy**

Where classical determinism erases agency  
and existentialism tries to invent it from nothing,  
situated determinism holds the center:

- Determinism gives the structure.
    
- Internal and external causes create the conditions.
    
- Awareness introduces possibility.
    
- Choice becomes an act of orientation, not origin.
    

Human freedom is not absolute — it is **contextual**, shaped by bandwidth, capacity, safety, and coherence.

The more coherent the awareness, the more spacious the effect.  
The more spacious the effect, the greater the degrees of freedom.

Freedom is therefore not metaphysical — it is **relational.**
