**Trauma Identity** — the self-concept built around a distorted chain when trauma becomes part of how a person explains themselves. It is not the trauma itself, but the meaning, narrative, and identity position created to survive it.

Trauma identity forms when the chain cannot close and memory remains charged. The person internalizes the distortion as “who I am,” not as “what happened.” This identity becomes stable because it protects the system from re-entering the original interruption. Story logic reinforces this identity, creating coherence through narrative rather than awareness.

Because trauma identity protects the system, it also shapes boundaries, perception, power, and relational posture. The person is not performing — they are adapting. The identity is a structural solution, not a flaw.

Integration does not erase the identity — it dissolves the distortion that created it. The self that emerges afterward is clearer, quieter, and no longer organized around survival. The architecture realigns, and the story loses its authority.

> Trauma identity isn’t your truth — it’s your architecture.
