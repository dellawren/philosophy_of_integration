## **Distortion and Interference** — any input that disrupts the natural completion of a causal chain.

Distortion and Interference describe what occurs when a causal sequence is prevented from completing as it otherwise would. The chain itself is not distorted. The **interruption of its progression** is what creates distortion.

Within the Integration framework, interference takes the form of added structure layered onto an active chain, such as moral judgment, forced correction, identity fusion, premature interruption, or substitution. These additions do not resolve the original sequence. They generate **secondary loops** that require ongoing energy to maintain, extending the life of the chain.

Distortion is therefore not a flaw in the system. It is evidence of **continued interaction** with an unresolved sequence. When interference ceases and contradictory inputs persist, the chain resolves without effort.

> “What prolongs a pattern is not the chain itself, but what is added to it.”
