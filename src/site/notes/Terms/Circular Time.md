**Circular Time** — the temporal experience of looping patterns produced by a distorted chain.

Circular time feels like returning to the same emotional landscapes over and over. It’s not mystical or symbolic — it’s architectural. The chain bends, the loop forms, and time reflects that shape.

In Integration, circular time dissolves the moment you stop feeding the distortion. When the chain straightens, time straightens with it.

> “You call it a pattern. Time calls it a circle.”
