**Distorted Power** — the attempt to generate safety through control, coercion, dominance, or emotional force when awareness is absent.

Distorted power is not power. It is the behaviour that emerges when someone cannot hold themselves and reaches outward to manage or shape others instead. This expression comes from fear, fragmentation, and the belief that safety must be manufactured through force or pressure. It impersonates authority but is rooted in insecurity.

In Integration, distorted power is recognized as the collapse state that stands opposite to true power. Real power does not control. It does not coerce. It does not need to impose. Distorted power dissolves once awareness returns, because the internal instability that caused it no longer drives behaviour.

> Distorted power is the performance of strength; power is the presence of it.
