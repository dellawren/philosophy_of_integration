**Freedom** is the capacity to live without internal division.  
It is not escape from systems or rules, but the end of resistance to what is.

In Stillhouse philosophy, freedom arises when control loses its hold — when the self no longer needs to defend, prove, or perform belonging.  
It is not granted by governments or earned through morality; it’s the natural state revealed when awareness integrates.

> Freedom is not the absence of structure — it’s the absence of fear.
