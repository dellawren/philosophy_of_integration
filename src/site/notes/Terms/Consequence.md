**Consequence** is the reflection of movement — the visible echo of cause revealing itself through time.  
It is not punishment or reward, but the natural continuation of energy returning to coherence.

In Stillhouse philosophy, consequence is how [[Terms/Truth\|truth]] makes itself known.  
It is the mirror through which awareness perceives its own alignment or distortion.  
Every consequence carries information — not instruction — inviting understanding rather than control.

When consequence is resisted, distortion repeats.  
When it is witnessed, balance restores itself without effort.  
Nothing escapes consequence because nothing stands outside relationship.

> Consequence is how truth remembers where it has been.
