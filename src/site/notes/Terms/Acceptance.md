**Acceptance** is the willingness to see what is — without resistance, justification, or demand for change.  
It is not passivity, nor agreement. It is awareness unarmed.

Acceptance holds truth without needing to reshape it.  
It does not condone harm or erase consequence; it simply ends the inner argument with reality.  
Where resistance divides, acceptance integrates. It transforms experience from something happening _to_ us into something happening _within_ us.

> Acceptance is not surrender — it is alignment. It is the moment when awareness stops fighting with truth.

Through acceptance, shame dissolves, guilt quiets, and victimization loses its form.  
It restores internal power, making choice possible again — not by control, but by clarity.
