**Truth** is what remains when perception quiets.  
It is not belief, agreement, or fact — it is direct alignment between awareness and reality.

Truth cannot be owned or weaponized; it reveals itself through coherence, not consensus.  
In Stillhouse philosophy, truth is not the opposite of lies but the dissolution of distortion.  
It expands as awareness expands.

> Truth does not take sides — it reveals patterns.
