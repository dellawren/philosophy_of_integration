**Truth** is what becomes visible when perception quiets enough to meet reality as it is.  
It is not belief, agreement, or fact — it is the recognition of what cause and effect is actually doing in a given moment.

Truth cannot be owned or weaponized; it does not belong to individuals or groups.  
It reveals itself when awareness stops distorting reality through fear, identity, or control.  
In Stillhouse philosophy, truth is not the opposite of lies — it is the clearing that appears when distortion dissolves.  
As awareness expands, the capacity to perceive truth expands with it.

Truth does not require consensus; it requires coherence with the underlying movement of reality.

> Truth does not take sides — it reveals patterns.
