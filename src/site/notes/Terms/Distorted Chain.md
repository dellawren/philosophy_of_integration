**Distorted Chain** — a causal sequence that continues to operate after the conditions that formed it are no longer present.

A distorted chain is not broken cause and effect. It is cause and effect running through **outdated architecture**. The sequence remains functional, but its outputs reflect prior conditions rather than current reality.

Distortion describes **misalignment**, not failure. The chain once preserved stability, safety, or continuity. When circumstances change but the chain persists, its consequences no longer correspond to the present moment.

A distorted chain does not collapse.  
It reroutes causality through protective filters such as memory, survival logic, reactive interpretation, or threat prediction.

Distorted chains persist because they are structurally stable, not because they are true. They remain active until the conditions that required them are no longer necessary, at which point new chains become available.

> A distorted chain is cause and effect shaped by what once preserved coherence.
