**Distorted Chain** — the cause-and-effect sequence that has been bent around survival, protection, collapsed boundaries, or inherited interpretation. A distorted chain is still functional, but it moves according to past architecture rather than present reality.

A distorted chain does not break; it reroutes.  
Cause and effect are filtered through:

- looping memory
    
- protective emotion
    
- reactive interpretation
    
- survival logic
    
- narrative self
    
- inherited trauma
    
- collapsed or overextended boundaries
    
- biological contraction
    

The system continues producing consequences, but those consequences reflect the distortion — not the moment. This is why distorted chains feel familiar, inevitable, or even moral from inside the loop. The architecture stabilizes the person by repeating what it already knows.

Distorted chains are not signs of pathology or failure.  
They are **maps** — showing the exact location where coherence became unavailable.  
Replacement, not correction, is the only coherent response. A distorted chain cannot be straightened; it must be replaced with architecture capable of holding awareness.

> A distorted chain is reality filtered through what once protected you.
