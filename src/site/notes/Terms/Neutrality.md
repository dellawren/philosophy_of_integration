**Neutrality** — the state of awareness that removes story, judgment, and preference so that truth can be seen without distortion.

Neutrality is not indifference, detachment, or emotional distance. It is the internal orientation that allows you to perceive cause and effect without collapsing into meaning, defence, or narrative. Neutrality clears the noise so the structure of an experience becomes visible. It does not negate feeling; it simply refuses to interpret feeling as fact.

Within Integration, neutrality is the stabilizing ground that replaces reactivity. When you are neutral, you are not choosing sides — you are choosing clarity. Neutrality breaks loops by removing the story logic that fuels them. It restores access to choice, responsibility, and coherence because nothing is being argued with or explained. It is the quiet space where truth stands without embellishment.

> Neutrality is where awareness becomes strong enough to stop performing.
