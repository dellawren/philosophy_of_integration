**Guilt** is the belief that one must make amends to re-enter belonging.  
It is a transactional emotion — the mind’s attempt to pay for perceived harm, real or imagined.

Unlike shame, which says _I am wrong_, guilt says _I did wrong_ — but both are rooted in the same distortion: that worth can be lost.  
Clean responsibility acknowledges cause and effect without self-condemnation. Guilt weaponizes that awareness and turns it inward.

> Guilt keeps one bound to the story; responsibility releases one from it.
