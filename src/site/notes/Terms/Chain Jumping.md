**Chain Jumping** — the metaphysical shift people mistake for “timeline jumping.”

Chain jumping occurs when you stop participating in a distorted chain and move into a coherent one so cleanly that your entire experiential reality changes. It feels like switching timelines, but it’s architectural, not mystical.

In Integration, chain jumping is simply the natural effect of moving from circular time to linear time.

> “You didn’t jump timelines — you stopped looping.”
