# **Temporal Architecture**

**Temporal Architecture** — the subjective experience of time as determined by the structure of the chain.

Within the framework, time is not treated as purely chronological. It is experienced according to whether the chain is coherent or distorted.

- When the chain is coherent, time is experienced as linear, sequential, and forward-moving.
    
- When the chain is distorted, time reorganizes into loops, compression, or suspension, producing repetition, recurrence, and the sense of being “stuck.”
    

Temporal architecture explains why unresolved chains reproduce familiar emotional states, relational patterns, and interpretations regardless of external change. The experience is not repetition of events, but persistence of structure.

Temporal architecture describes _how time is lived_, not how it is measured.

### **Framework Notes**

- Temporal distortion is structural, not psychological
    
- Looping time reflects an open or interrupted chain
    
- Linear time resumes when the chain regains coherence
    

Temporal architecture resolves when awareness becomes available and the chain completes or is replaced.
