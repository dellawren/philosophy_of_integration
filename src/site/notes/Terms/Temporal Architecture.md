# **Temporal Architecture**

**Temporal Architecture** — the experience of time shaped by the chain’s structure.

When the chain is coherent, time feels linear and progressive. When the chain is distorted, time bends into loops: repeating patterns, recurring emotional states, déjà vu, and the sense of being “stuck.”

Temporal architecture reframes time as experiential, not chronological. It is the internal architecture that shapes the timeline you walk.

> “You’re not looping through time — the chain is looping through you.”
