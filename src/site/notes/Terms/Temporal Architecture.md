**Temporal Architecture** — the way time is structured and experienced as a function of chain coherence.

Time itself does not distort.  
**The chain does.**

When a chain is coherent, time is experienced as sequential: cause leads to effect, events complete, and attention moves forward. When a chain is distorted, time collapses into repetition. Effects recur without resolution, emotional states repeat, and the future narrows to variations of the past.

Temporal architecture describes how unresolved chains **hold awareness in place**, producing the felt experience of looping, suspension, acceleration, or stagnation. This is not psychological illusion and not chronological error. It is a structural consequence of an incomplete causal sequence.

Temporal architecture is therefore not about clocks or calendars.  
It is about whether the chain has permission to move on.

A chain that has not closed cannot progress through time.  
A chain that resolves restores sequence automatically.
