**Replacement** — the act of shifting into a coherent chain rather than attempting to fix a distorted one.

Healing doesn’t repair the old architecture. Replacement installs a new one. You choose the interpretation aligned with truth, and the old pattern loses power through non-participation.

In Integration, replacement is the mechanism of transformation. It is clean, rapid, and permanent because coherence does not loop.

> “You don’t fix the pattern — you stop feeding it.”
