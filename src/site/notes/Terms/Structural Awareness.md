**Structural Awareness** — awareness aimed at the architecture beneath the reaction, not the reaction itself.

Structural awareness is the shift from “What am I feeling?” to “What is the chain doing?” Instead of personalizing emotion or thought, you observe the mechanics behind them. This is the moment awareness detaches from the loop and becomes capable of choice.

In Integration, structural awareness is the first real liberating movement. It dissolves self-blame, emotional defensiveness, and moral judgement by revealing the architecture generating the experience.

> “Awareness isn’t self-control — it’s the refusal to confuse the reaction with the truth.”
