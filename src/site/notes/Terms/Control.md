**Control** — the introduction of an external cause into another person’s causal sequence.

Within the Integration framework, control is not authority, guidance, care, or coordination. It is **interference**: an action taken to redirect, suppress, accelerate, or manage a causal loop that does not belong to the one acting.

Control arises when natural consequence is judged insufficient and is replaced with imposed outcome. Rather than allowing a chain to complete, control inserts an additional cause, altering the sequence and producing secondary effects that did not originate in the original loop.

Because control interrupts rather than resolves cause and effect, it generates new conditions that require further management. The original cause remains active, while the imposed intervention creates additional consequences that must also be regulated. This produces escalation rather than stability.

Control does not eliminate uncertainty. It redistributes it.

In Integration, control is therefore understood as a **structural destabilizer**, not a corrective mechanism. Order emerges from completed causality; control substitutes completion with management.

> Control is interference mistaken for resolution.
