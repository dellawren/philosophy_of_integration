**Control** — the attempt to override or manage another person’s causal loop.  
In Integration, control is not authority, guidance, or protection. It is interference: a foreign cause introduced into a sequence that does not belong to the one imposing it.

Control arises from distrust — the belief that natural consequence is insufficient and must be supplemented, corrected, or accelerated. But every act of control disrupts the causal loop it attempts to “fix,” generating new fragmentation and additional consequences.

Control is structurally identical to a medication with side effects.  
It suppresses the expression of the original cause, creates new problems, and then demands further control to manage the complications it created. The system becomes more chaotic precisely because the original cause was never allowed to resolve.

Control therefore does not create order — it destabilizes it. What appears as “necessary intervention” is simply interference looping back on itself.

> **Control is the chaos everyone was trying to prevent.**
