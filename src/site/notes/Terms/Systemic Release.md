**Systemic release** is the process of withdrawing consent from inherited systems of control.  
It is not rebellion but recognition — the quiet decision to stop performing belonging for a structure that requires self-betrayal.

Systemic release does not destroy systems; it neutralizes their power by removing participation.  
It is the moment when awareness replaces obedience, and responsibility becomes internal rather than imposed.

> Systemic release asks, “Who am I when I no longer need permission?”
