**Choice** is the conscious recognition of agency within limitation.  
It is not unlimited freedom, but awareness of participation in cause and effect.

In Stillhouse philosophy, choice is not about control — it is about alignment.  
It marks the moment when awareness moves from observation to direction, not to force an outcome but to act in coherence with truth.

Choice does not promise certainty; it reveals responsibility.  
Every choice is an act of self-creation — a statement of who we are within the field of consequence.

> Choice is awareness deciding how to move.
