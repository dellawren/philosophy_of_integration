**Ethics** is the natural expression of inner coherence — the alignment between awareness, truth, and action.  
It is not a code, nor a rulebook, but the lived balance between cause and effect as understood through awareness.

In Stillhouse philosophy, ethics arise organically when the individual is integrated.  
Moral systems attempt to legislate this alignment from the outside; ethics simply reveal it from within.  
Where morality seeks obedience, ethics seek understanding.

Ethics are therefore situational, fluid, and self-regulating — a mirror of one’s internal integrity rather than conformity to external law.

> Ethics are not learned through punishment, but revealed through awareness.
