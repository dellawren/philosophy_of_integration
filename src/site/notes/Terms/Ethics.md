**Ethics** is the natural expression of inner coherence — the alignment between awareness, truth, and action.  
It is not a code or rulebook, but the living rhythm of cause and effect perceived through awareness.

In Stillhouse philosophy, ethics is the _instrument of coherence_ that restores natural balance when it has been lost.  

It arises organically from integration, not instruction. Moral systems attempt to legislate this alignment from the outside; ethics simply reveal it from within.

Where [[Terms/Morality\|morality]] seeks obedience, ethics seek understanding.  
Where morality enforces control, ethics restores coherence.

Ethics are therefore situational, fluid, and self-regulating — a mirror of one’s internal integrity rather than conformity to external law.

> Ethics are not learned through punishment, but remembered through awareness.
