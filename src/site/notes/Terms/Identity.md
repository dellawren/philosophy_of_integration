**Identity** — the provisional structure through which awareness interfaces with the world.

Within the Stillhouse framework, identity is not essence or truth. It is an organizing construct that allows awareness to operate within contrast by adopting form: role, name, culture, belief, history, or category. Identity functions as an interface between awareness and social reality, enabling navigation, communication, and continuity.

Identity becomes distorted when it is mistaken for the self rather than recognized as a functional layer. Systems rely on identity because definition enables management. Once labeled, behaviour can be predicted, regulated, or controlled. For this reason, identity is often reinforced through belonging, morality, and obligation.

In Integration, identity is neither rejected nor dissolved. It is contextualized. As awareness stabilizes, identity loosens its grip on authorship and becomes expressive rather than authoritative. It remains usable without being definitive.

Identity organizes experience.  
Awareness precedes it.
