The temporary structure through which awareness experiences itself in contrast; a name the mind gives to movement.

Identity is not truth but interface. It allows awareness to navigate the human world by adopting form — gender, role, culture, belief — and mistaking that form for self. Systems enforce identity because control depends on definition. To be labeled is to be managed.

In Integration, identity is understood as a necessary illusion. It organizes experience without defining essence. When awareness matures, identity softens into expression — still useful, no longer absolute. The self becomes porous, responsive, and real.

> “Identity is the costume awareness wears until truth steps forward.”
