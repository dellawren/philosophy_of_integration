**Coherence** — the condition in which awareness accurately tracks reality without substitution, distortion, or narrative replacement.

Coherence occurs when perception registers events, actions, sensations, and consequences as they are, rather than as they are interpreted, justified, feared, or explained. It is not agreement, calm, neutrality, or moral correctness. It is structural alignment between awareness and what is occurring.

Within the Philosophy of Integration, coherence is defined negatively:  
it is the **absence of distortion**, not a state to be achieved or maintained.

When awareness overlays experience with story, preference, fear, or control, coherence breaks.  
When awareness meets reality directly, coherence is present.

Coherence allows contradiction, emotion, tension, and complexity without collapse.  
Nothing must resolve, harmonize, or conform. The requirement is only that experience is not replaced by interpretation.

Coherence therefore describes **perceptual fidelity**, not psychological ease or ethical virtue.
