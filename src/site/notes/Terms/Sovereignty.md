**Sovereignty** — the absolute primacy of positional awareness within one’s own causal loop.  
Sovereignty is not power over others; it is the recognition that only the person inside an event can meet its reality without distortion.

In Integration, sovereignty establishes the boundary that prevents external interpretation from masquerading as clarity. No one else has access to your nervous system, meaning-making, history, thresholds of awareness, or internal cause. Therefore, no one else can “understand” your loop without altering it.

Sovereignty is the antidote to authority, moral intrusion, and interpretive control. It defines the limits of what can be known from the outside and protects the integrity of the causal sequence. Without sovereignty, every system devolves into interference.
