**Phenomenology** — the study of lived experience as the primary source of understanding.  
It claims that truth is encountered through direct experience, not through beliefs, theories, or inherited concepts about reality.

Phenomenology shifts philosophy out of abstraction and back into life. It values how reality is _felt, perceived, and lived_ rather than how it is explained. It reminds us that the meaning of anything begins where we experience it, not where we rationalize it.

[[Terms/Integration\|Integration]] builds on this by adding awareness to experience — seeing not only _what happened_, but how it is being held, interpreted, or distorted. Experience is the doorway; integration is the movement through it.

> Experience shows us life; awareness lets us live it.
