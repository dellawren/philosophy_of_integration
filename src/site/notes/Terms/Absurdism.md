**Absurdism** — the philosophy that explores the tension between our desire for meaning and the universe’s indifference to providing one.  
It names “the absurd” as the clash between human expectation and life’s refusal to conform to it.

Absurdism frees us by removing the requirement that life must make sense. But if misunderstood, it can lead to detachment — a passive acceptance rather than a lived experience.

In [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]], the release of meaning is not an escape from life but a return to it. Once life no longer needs justification, it becomes intimate and immediate.

> When meaning stops being a requirement, presence becomes possible.
