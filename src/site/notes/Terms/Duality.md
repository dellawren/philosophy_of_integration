**Duality** is the human perception of separation through opposites.  
It divides life into categories — self and other, right and wrong, good and bad — to make experience understandable.

Duality is not a flaw in consciousness but a tool of perception.  
It allows contrast, relationship, and meaning-making.  
The distortion arises only when duality is mistaken for absolute truth rather than a lens through which awareness navigates life.

In [[Terms/Integration\|Integration]], duality is honoured as part of the human experience.  
It is not denied or transcended — it is included.  
Integration recognizes duality as one of many layers of perception, not the whole of reality.

> Duality isn’t the opposite of truth — it’s one way of seeing it.
