**Duality** — the human perception of separation through opposites.  
It divides life into categories — self and other, right and wrong, good and bad — to make experience understandable.

Duality is not a flaw in consciousness; it is a tool for human perception. It allows contrast, comparison, and meaning-making. Problems arise only when duality is mistaken for absolute truth, rather than a lens we use to navigate life.

In Integration, duality is honoured as part of the human experience. It is not denied or transcended — it is included. Integration sees duality as one of many layers of perception, not the whole of reality.

> Duality isn’t the opposite of truth — it’s one way of seeing it.
