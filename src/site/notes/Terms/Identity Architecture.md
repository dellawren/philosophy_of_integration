**Identity Architecture** — the narrative structure built around an inherited chain; the story a person uses to explain the pattern.

Identity forms around whatever chain the child had to adopt to stay connected, accepted, or safe. Over time, the story becomes fused with personality, preference, and self-concept. But none of it is original — it is the architecture of survival, not essence.

Integration reveals identity as a construct: something learned, inherited, or absorbed. When the chain changes, the identity dissolves naturally.
