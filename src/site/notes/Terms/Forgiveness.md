**Forgiveness** is not the act of absolving another; it is the release of oneself from the illusion of debt.  
It does not require apology, reconciliation, or explanation — only awareness.

True forgiveness occurs when the mind stops insisting that the past should have been different.  
It is the moment when the story no longer dictates the present, and energy once bound to blame becomes available for truth.

Forgiveness does not rewrite history; it ends the need to carry it.  
It restores balance by dissolving the perceived transaction between harm and reparation.

> Forgiveness is not a gift to the other — it is the quiet return of your own freedom.
