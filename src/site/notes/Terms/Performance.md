**Performance** — the behavioural expression of an inherited chain where a person behaves according to expectation, approval, or safety rather than truth.

Performance is what happens when identity merges with survival logic. Instead of responding from awareness, the person enacts the role that keeps the system stable — the “good one,” the agreeable one, the competent one, the quiet one, the strong one, the responsible one. Performance feels natural because it grew alongside the distorted chain that shaped it.

In Integration, performance isn’t viewed as inauthenticity; it’s viewed as a _protective architecture._ It preserves belonging, prevents conflict, and maintains the familiar dynamics of a relationship or environment. But every performance costs coherence. The more a person performs, the more they abandon internal truth to maintain external stability.

Performance dissolves automatically when the chain is replaced. There is no need to “stop performing.” When the architecture stops demanding it, the behaviour disappears.

> “Performance isn’t who you are — it’s who the distortion needed you to be.”
