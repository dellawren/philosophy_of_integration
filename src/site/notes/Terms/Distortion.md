**Distortion** — the bend in the cause-and-effect chain where interpretation overrides truth and redirects awareness back into an inherited or protective pattern.

Distortion isn’t error, flaw, or moral failure. It is the structural shift that occurs when the original chain is interrupted by fear, conditioning, identity formation, or survival logic. Instead of awareness following the moment, awareness follows the pattern that once kept the system safe. Distortion is always functional in origin — it preserved connection, stability, or survival — but over time, it becomes a loop that replaces truth with repetition.

In The Philosophy of Integration, distortion is not something to fix or heal. It is something to _see._ Once the architecture is visible, the distortion loses its authority. It doesn’t need resolution; it needs replacement. Coherence emerges not by correcting the bend, but by choosing a new chain that no longer requires it.

> “Distortion is not the enemy — it is the shape your life took when you didn’t yet have a choice.”
